""The House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused each other Tuesday of trying to intimidate State Department officials called as witnesses in the probe.

Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said any attempt by Pompeo to prevent department officials from speaking to them ‚Äúis illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction,‚Äù according to a statement issued by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who heads the foreign affairs panel.

The Democrats‚Äô statement came after Pompeo informed them hours earlier that five State Department officials called to give depositions in the inquiry into President Trump‚Äôs actions regarding Ukraine over the next two weeks would not appear as scheduled this week.""

To get even more TYT in your life, go to https://TYT.com/app and download our free app!

Read more here: 
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/trump-i-have-the-absolute-right-to-pardon-myself.html

""President Donald Trump said Monday he has ""the absolute right"" to pardon himself ‚Äî but added that he has ""done nothing wrong."" The tweet followed The New York Times' publication of a confidential letter over the weekend, in which Trump's lawyers argued to special counsel Robert Mueller that the president's broad powers mean he could not have obstructed justice.

The 20-page letter also suggested that the president even wields the constitutional ability to exercise the pardon power in matters related to the special counsel's probe of the links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

La juventud mexicana lo hizo una vez m√°s, y demuestra que trabajando juntos somos enormes.
La selecci√≥n mexicana sub-12 en la ciudad de Nueva York se midi√≥ con 32 selecciones, justa deportiva en la que los tricolores recibieron muestras de apoyo por parte de sus contrincantes en la cancha al saber de la desgracia del 19 de septiembre.
Tuvieron un tropiezo, cayeron por la m√≠nima diferencia contra la selecci√≥n de Suiza, pero esa lecci√≥n se aprendi√≥ y gan√≥ todos sus partidos enfrentado a Corea del Sur, Senegal, Francia, Indonesia y Rumania, su √∫ltimo sinodal ser√≠a Argentina, una selecci√≥n con la que los nacionales tienen familiaridad.
Durante la tarde de este domingo 24, a las 15:15 dio inicio el duelo entre la selecci√≥n de M√©xico y la selecci√≥n Argentina en el Red Bull Arena, estadio que cuenta con una capacidad de 25 mil personas.
Las Chivas del Guadalajara fue el equipo que represent√≥ a M√©xico durante la Copa Naciones Danone 2017, en donde salieron campeones del torneo, luego de derrotar a Argentina por 2-0.
Luego de la mala situaci√≥n por la que atraviesa nuestro pa√≠s, la escuadra azteca le regal√≥ una gran alegr√≠a a M√©xico al poder alzar el t√≠tulo en Nueva York.
El equipo no tuvo un buen arranque en la Copa, pese a ello, supo dejar atr√°s la derrota y enfocarse en el objetivo principal. Con goles de Mario Santos y Emilio Hern√°ndez, M√©xico queda como bicampe√≥n, ya que en la edici√≥n del 2010 tambi√©n logr√≥ obtener el t√≠tulo.
El torneo ha sido evaluado por FIFA, hecho que ayudar√° a cada uno de los jugadores a lo largo de su carrera profesional como futbolistas."

Sidhe saade pendu jatt ne
Poore pind vich att karvati x (2)

Ho akhaan vekhde shareek paad paad ne
Jehde langde si muchhe chaad chaad ke x (2)

Ho mehnatan nu kende sada lagde ne bhaag
Kothi sanjhi kandh utte karwati
Sidhe saade pendu jatt ne

Ho sidhe saade pendu jatt ne
Poore pind vich att karvati x (2)

Ho 8 saalan vich badle riwaaj ji
Land hoya jadon jatt da jahaj ji x (2)

Ohi ne shareek jehde bande si ghaint ji
Jeev naak naal ohna di lawati
Sidhe saade pendu jatt ne

Ho sidhe saade pendu jatt ne
Poore pind vich att karvati x (2)

Jatt poora kaim, 100 bata 100
Dukh aunde rehne jivein unglan de noh
Maa meri de main jholi pa ta saara sukh
Bapu mera rakhda ae khadi hunn muchh

Ho bhawein mardi aan goriya ne jatt te
Meri taur ne jattan de put patt te x (2)

Sirre di shokeen ajj jatt naal khadi
Yaaron kaiyan nu ae dandhan pawa ti
Sidhe saade pendu jatt ne

Ho sidhe saade pendu jatt ne
Poore pind vich att karvati x (2)

Ho maana maan ni karida kise gall te
Time changey maade bande utte chalde x (2)

Ajj aan ameer ho ja kal nu fakeer
Par ik bar duniya hilati
Sidhe saade pendu jatt ne

Ho sidhe saade pendu jatt ne
Poore pind vich att karwati x (2)"

Summary:  I fulfilled a 3 year long dream to create a dartboard where you get a bullseye every time thanks to some engineering.  Basically, you throw a dart and then a Vicon motion capture system tracks the dart in the air.  We use those x,y,z positions in matlab to predict where the dart will land using some regression analysis.  Once we know where it will land, we move the board to the right spot using 6 stepper motors that attach to the back of the board using fishing line.  All of this happens in 400ms or so.  Then we took it to a bar to see what people would think of it (SPOILER ALERT: they liked it)

""The House passed legislation to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday, hours after Democrats took control of the chamber and elected Nancy Pelosi as Speaker.

The House measures appear to be dead on arrival in the Senate and have been rejected by President Trump, who is demanding that $5 billion in funding for his wall on the Mexican border. Democrats have rejected providing money for Trump‚Äôs wall.

But the measures could shift the debate as Democrats seek to raise pressure on the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to end a standoff centered on the fight over the wall.""

""A dozen GOP Pennsylvania lawmakers filed legislation on Tuesday to impeach four Democratic state Supreme Court justices who ruled the state‚Äôs congressional map was unconstitutionally gerrymandered and replaced it with a new one.

The Republicans moved to impeach Justices David Wecht, Christine Donahue, Kevin Dougherty and Debra McCloskey Todd, all Democrats who found the state‚Äôs congressional map was designed to favor Republicans and must be replaced before the May primary. Justice Max Baer (D), who also voted to strike down the map, but said it could remain in place until 2020, wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the impeachment resolutions.

The legislation comes a little more than a month after state Rep. Cris Dush (R) urged impeachment of the Democratic justices. The state Supreme Court ruled in January 5-2, along party lines, that congressional districts drawn in 2011 were so lopsided to benefit Republicans that they violated the guarantee of free and equal elections. The court gave lawmakers three weeks to draw a new map with Gov. Tom Wolf (D), but imposed its own plan once they failed to reach an agreement. Two Republican appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal lawsuit have been unsuccessful in blocking the new map.‚Äù*

--- LYRICS
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more that I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more that I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for
The longest time"

Lyrics
Bruno Mars - Natalie

Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone 
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I spend your lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma oh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone 
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
I should've known better (I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever (She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played her game
Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone 
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

Lyrics 

Adele- Hello 
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Buggles - Video killed the radio star 1979
LYRICS:

I heard you on the wireless back in 52
lying awake intent a tuning in on you
if I was young it didn't stop you coming through

They took the credit for your second symphony
re-written by machine and new technology
and now I understand the problems you can see

Oh oh -- I met your children
oh oh -- what did you tell them
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
pictures came and broke your heart
we can't rewind we've gone too far

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
we hear the playback and it seems so long ago
and you remember the jingle used to go

Oh oh -- you were the first one
oh oh -- you were the last one
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
in my mind and in my car
we can't rewind we've gone too far

Video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
in my mind and in my car
we can't rewind we've gone too far

(Instrumental)

Video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star

In my mind and in my car
we can't rewind we've gone too far
pictures came and broke your heart
look I'll play my VCR

Oh radio star
Oh radio star

Video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star

Video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star
video killed the radio star

Summary:  I lost my wallet.  That made me curious about what kind of person doesn't return a found wallet.  So I got 200 wallets and dropped them in 10 cities to collect data to rank the honesty of the cities and to build a profile of an honest person.  We looked at variables such as male v. female, age, high income v. low income, religious v. non-religious, small town v. big town.

Summary:  I wanted to see if I could make an app that could decode baseball signs.  Turns out we could and it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Machine Learning and neural networks and artificial intelligence from my friend Jabril.

Lyrics

Nothing can save us, nothing between
Infinite madness and the spiral of humanity
Nothing controls us, nothing breeds
The void awakens in the quickening of atrophy
Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul
Equal to break
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain
Nothing kills us, nothing seethes
Extinction riding on the pale horse of destiny
Nothing hates us, nothing can see
Through our eyes it dives into our minds
And sows its disease
Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul
Equal to break
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain
It‚Äôs alive, can you feel it
It‚Äôs alive
Can you feel it taking hold again
In your mind
All your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain

Let‚Äôs go fly a kite! Turn an old plastic bag into a DIY kite with this easy plastic bag craft project. Follow these steps and you‚Äôll be able to turn materials from around your home into a day of outdoor entertainment.

For your homemade kite, choose sticks that are thin, lightweight and relatively straight. They should be similar in size to the plastic bag. As you‚Äôd imagine, smaller sticks will work better with a smaller bag, whereas longer sticks work best for a garbage bag. You can also use wooden dowels if you prefer.

Using the sticks and string, build the frame of your DIY kite first. One stick should be slightly shorter than the other, approximately 4 to 6 inches depending on the size of your kite. Measurements do not need to be exact.

Cross the smaller stick over the longer stick in the shape of a lower-case T. The horizontal stick will be about one-third of the way from the top of the vertical stick. Secure the sticks together using the string and glue. Place a dot of glue between the two sticks and then wrap the string around the intersection several times ensuring that the sticks meet at a right angle.

The rest is in the video...

MILL LO NA LYRICS

Gol gol gallan
Gallan kar diyan gol gol
Gol gol gallan
Gallan kar diyan gol gol

Mainu kehndi mill lo na
Mil lo na, mil lo na
Oh mainu kehndi mil lo na
Par time ni mittran kol
Time ni mitran kol
Par time ni mitran kol
time ni‚Ä¶ time ni‚Ä¶ time ni‚Ä¶

Mill lo na, mill lo na (x4)

Ni tu sochi na ki jatt pyar nai karda
Ni tu sochi na ki jatt pyar nai karda
Hill gaya tere piche ghum ghum ke
Hill gaya tere piche ghum ghum ke

Ni tu sochi na ki jatt pyar nai karda
Hill gaya tere piche ghum ghum ke
Kal 3-4 phaad diyan baby
Photo‚Äôaan teriyan chum chum ke

Ni agg barabar laggi ae
Bhavein feeling‚Äôaan nu le dho

Mainu kehndi mill lo na
Mill lo na, mill lo na
Oh mainu kehndi mill lo na
Par time ni mittran kol
Gol gol gallan
Gallan kar diyan gol gol

Main yaaran beliyan de naal busy nakhro
Leya na tu kar mainu easy nakhro
Pyar mainu kardi aa beshak ni
Kareya na kar kam cheesy nakhro
Cheesy nakhro‚Ä¶

Ho naam Jaani ae Jaani
Akalaan de kunde khol

Mainu kehndi mill lo na
Mill lo na, mill lo na
Oh mainu kehndi mil lo na
Par time ni mitran kol
Gol gol gallan
Gallan kar diyan gol gol

Kar diyan gol gol (x3)
Mill lo na, mill lo na (x4)

These are the small celebs and shortest actresses and the shortest female celebrities in the world!


8. Scarlett Johansson - This seductive icon began her career as a child. She made her debut on the big screen in the 1994 movie North, in which she played alongside actor, Elijah Wood. Johansson also starred in the 1996 film Manny & Lo, for which she received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award. From then on, her career snowballed as she gained recognition for roles such as her portrayal of Charlotte in 2003‚Äôs Lost in Translation, in which she forms a bond with Bill Murray‚Äôs character, Bob Harris. She won a few awards for this hit, such as the BAFTA Film Award and BSFC Award. Johansson‚Äôs other work includes The Black Dahlia in 2006, Her in 2013, and Lucy from 2014. Of course, we can‚Äôt forget her role as Black Widow in the Avengers film series, a stealthy superhero with unmatched athleticism. Although this actress is known for her proven skills on-screen, she‚Äôs also recognized for some off-screen characteristics. Scarlett Johansson doesn‚Äôt quite have her head in the clouds, standing at just 5‚Äô3‚Äù, but her short stature hasn‚Äôt prevented her from reaching for the stars throughout her Hollywood career. 
                     
7. Anna Kendrick - This dainty actress is known for her quirky sense of humor and her work in numerous popular films. Although she had a few acting gigs before her big break, this star earned most of her recognition through the teenage vampire romance, Twilight, in 2008. Kendrick played the part of Jessica, the main character‚Äôs peppy, somewhat boy-crazy, friend. She went on to play in the movie‚Äôs sequels from 2009 to 2012. She‚Äôs also been a part of several other films, including the Pitch Perfect series from 2012 to 2017, where she played a talented vocalist named Beca. Kendrick‚Äôs also had roles in Up in the Air in 2009, for which she received an Oscar nomination, and The Accountant in 2016, in which she worked alongside Ben Affleck. This New England-born actress has also secured a few awards throughout her career, like the MTV Movie Award in 2010 and 2013 and the CinemaCon Award in 2016. However, Kendrick isn‚Äôt only known for her professional success; fans recognize her for her short stature as well. At just 5‚Äô2‚Äù, she‚Äôs very petite, but that hasn‚Äôt prevented her from making a big impression on fans worldwide."

OVER THE VOICE OF HOLLAND
The voice of Holland is d√© talentenjacht die iedere vrijdagavond vanaf 20.30 uur te zien is bij RTL 4. Bij deze show gaat het om √©cht talent. Alleen het beste van het beste is goed genoeg. De beste stem en de juiste mentaliteit, daar draait het om. The voice of Holland is op zoek naar iemand met grote klasse, met blijvende impact en een eigen geluid. De talenten worden tijdens The voice of Holland begeleid, gecoacht, gedrild en gesteund door Nederlandse topartiesten.
Na een strenge voorselectie mag een klein aantal talenten een Blind Audition doen voor de coaches Anouk, Sanne Hans, Ali B en Marco Borsato. Talenten doen geen saaie auditie vanuit een lege ruimte, maar staan gelijk met een liveband op een √©cht podium. De coaches selecteren hoogstpersoonlijk de talenten die zij willen coachen en begeleiden op de weg naar een succesvolle zangcarri√®re."

Amazon UK ‚Äì http://allam.co/a7rii
Amazon US ‚Äì http://allam.co/us-a7rii

My weeklong road trip with VickyFlipFlop was amazing! We stopped at so many places and did so many things, it's really hard to process just how much we did! With our Ford Mustang, we drove over 1,000 miles between visiting the cities and driving to each activity and other scenic routes.

During the trip, I filmed daily vlogs for each of the locations and made some high quality sequences with my Sony A7R II. This video is a supercut of all the high quality sequences together to give an overall insight into the trip!

Some of the activities we did in Florida were: go-karting, air-boating, Segwaying, beach lazing, Daytona Speedwaying, Kennedy Space Centering, and a whole lot of Mustanging!

If you enjoyed this video, I'd recommend checking out the individual vlogs for behind the scenes action. You should also stay tuned for much more travel related content on the way soon!

--

This trip was sponsored by Hertz and VisitFlorida as part of VisitFlorida‚Äôs Moments of Sunshine. I travelled with another travel blogger VickyFlipFlop, through 6 cities across Florida, USA; and will be releasing many more videos from the trip throughout January, 2016!

Don't worry, these vlogs will be rearranged chronologically in the Florida playlist once they're all uploaded...

Lyrics 
Nico & Vinz - Am I Wrong

Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I'll choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know, how far would I grow?
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
Am I tripping for having a vision?
My prediction, I'mma be on the top of the world
Hope you, hope you don't look back, always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see

Lyrics 
MAGIC! - Rude 

Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah (yeah)

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
""Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!""

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Yeah, no matter what you say (marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be boys, standin' at that altar
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
""Tough luck, my friend, cause the answer's still no!""

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Yeah, no matter what you say (marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude? Yeah (so rude)

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
""Tough luck, my friend, but no still means no!""

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Marry her anyway (marry that girl)
Yeah, no matter what you say (marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?
Why, why, why, why? (Say)
Say, why you gotta be so rude?

LYRICS:
Moving too fast life is moving in slow-mo
I‚Äôm a god better ask if you don‚Äôt know
Homie better put your pride aside
I‚Äôm a Benz and you‚Äôre more like a Volvo
 
Your best stuff looks like my worst, synapses fire and burst
Got the whole crew with me, ‚Äòbout to deal damage, you know we ain‚Äôt average
 
I ain‚Äôt gonna say this again, but this is my time better look in my eyes
I‚Äôm a genius in disguise, wear my heart on my sleeve and you forced to oblige to a king in his Prime
everybody get in Line
sit back, watch the stars Align
I finesse like my life on the Line 
was a diamond in the rough and now I Shine
 
Ay‚Ä¶ no one can stop us they‚Äôll try but they won‚Äôt
Ay‚Ä¶ nada nos puede parar, oh no!
 
We‚Äôre wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
We‚Äôre running this world, we keeping it turning
We‚Äôre living like Giants (yea Giants)
We‚Äôre bigger than Giants (we Giants)
Oh oh oh oh
 
Sleeping Giants, sleeping, sleeping Giants
 
Shutting it down, been underground now my people all up in this place
Spinning this thing, gold on my ring, royalty up in my veins
I‚Äôm loco, think I‚Äôm so cold, I stay stunting, ain‚Äôt no goin' back
Now they ask where QiQi‚Äôs at, I'm like you can't hang with that

Please subscribe now: https://bit.ly/2DwW4BZ

More than a year ago I made a video about the famous Inca or Pre-Inca Stone walls of Peru and I presented the hypothesis that the reason they are made from irregular blocks of stone yet interlock so perfectly is because they are made by stacking cement bags.

Although I‚Äôve presented the idea, many viewers have pointed out a number of problems with the hypothesis and I have to admit that geologically this idea doesn‚Äôt work as the rocks have been analysed and their quarries have been located. So I have since been searching for an alternative explanation and I believe I‚Äôve found a researcher who does have the answer.

Thanks to a subscriber who sent me a link, I have read a paper by Helmut Tributsch for the SDRP Journal for Earth Sciences and Environmental Studies back in December 2017, titled ‚ÄòOn the reddish, glittery mud the Inca used for perfecting their stone masonry‚Äô and wow, I think he may have solved this age-old conundrum. In this video I will quote his paper and present Helmet‚Äôs ideas but I strongly urge you to download his paper by clicking the link: http://www.academia.edu/37497925/On_the_reddish_glittery_mud_the_Inca_used_for_perfecting_their_stone_masonry

""First lady Melania Trump took a trip to the US-Mexico border on Thursday to tour an immigrant children's shelter, but her trip is getting attention not only for her action, but also for her wardrobe choice before and after the journey.

As the first lady boarded her plane from Andrews Air Force Base, she wore an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read: ""I really don't care. Do u?"" in white graffiti-style lettering. Trump was not wearing the jacket when she landed in McAllen, Texas. She re-donned the jacket and wore it when she deplaned back at Andrews Air Force Base despite the media storm that had erupted over her initial wearing.""

Lyrics 
James Bay- Let It Go

From walking home and talking loads
Seeing shirts in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
Oh, this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make it feel right, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now is the time to let it slide
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me
Come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me

I started by marking out where I wanted to build the pool. I followed by digging out the area all the while piling up the sand on the borders. By piling up the sand, you can increase the perceived depth of the pool without too much digging. I packed the ""castle walls"" and added a tower with the extra sand I had. I topped it all off with some shells sourced locally (as in right down the beach. . . ) One thing to note is that without a tarp or plastic liner, the water will drain through the sand fairly quickly so fill quick and fill often. ; )

I also added an unboxing section to the end of this video. 
The Woodbrew channel did a giveaway on their instagram. I won! I finished this video off with me opening the package and playing with the prize.

Here is a behind the scenes video from the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJIc1iAQdPw

High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.  They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.

ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.

Chris Hemsworth is one of those rare actors who can do it all. The Australian star clearly excels in action films, considering he's the mighty Thor of the Avengers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But he can also handle fantasy, comedy, drama, and even horror. This kind of versatility means that Hemsworth is regularly on set, and all those long hours can make even the biggest movie stars a little loopy. Well, the results have been caught on film. Here are some of the best Chris Hemsworth bloopers...

Summary:  I built a rock skipping robot with the help of my nieces and nephews to understand the perfect way to skip a rock.  In the end we learned that 4 things matter most:

1) Rock angle of 20 degrees
2) Rock PATH angle of 20 degrees
3) Spin the rock as much as possible
4) Choose a rock that is flat on the bottom and as heavy as possible for you to still get to your max arm speed.

""President Trump canceled an invitation to the White House for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, saying that ‚Äústaying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem‚Äù was ‚Äúdisrespectful.‚Äù

This explanation, however, makes no sense. No Eagles players ever stayed in the locker room during the national anthem, nor did any players kneel during the regular season or the playoffs.

And when Fox News tried to pile on by showing footage of players it claimed were protesting during the national anthem, it backfired ‚Äî because those players weren‚Äôt protesting; they were praying.

Trump believes that NFL anthem protests are a winning issue for him; after all, culture war politics have served him well. The more the focus is on race and other identity issues, the better off he is. But conservatives are starting to reconsider their positions.‚Äù*

""President Donald Trump mangled the name of a top defense executive while announcing Thursday that the US would soonimpose tariffs on imported Chinese goods.

He introduced Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, who was there to voice support for the move, as ""Marillyn Lockheed.""
""We have some of our great business leaders, and leaders period right behind me,"" Trump said at the podium before asking Hewson to say a few words.

""I may ask Marillyn Lockheed, the leading women's business executive in this country, according to many,"" Trump said.‚Äù*

Investigators for the Houston SPCA get more than they bargained for when they are called in to assist police at a commercial dog breeding facility in Coryell County. There are more than two hundred Rottweilers on the premises including dozens of newborn puppies. What should be a routine seizure becomes a nightmare when a freak ice storm hits Texas and temperatures plummet to below freezing. As the Investigators attempt to round up the dogs the vets battle to keep the newborns alive. Inside the owners' home ammonia levels are so high that the local fire department has deemed the property unsafe to enter and the team has to don respirators and protective clothing to rescue more dogs trapped inside. Once the dogs are on safely on the vehicles the team faces an even more dangerous challenge. At the rear of the property are two mountain lions and two Bengal tigers.

""Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has made yet another expensive purchase drawing criticism from the public. The spending this time? Thousands on personalized office supplies.

The order included personalized pens and journals, specifically 12 silver personalized pens with the EPA seal and Pruitt‚Äôs signature on them costing $1,560 alone, The Washington Post reported. The other items, including personalized journals, totaled $1,670.

Emails relating to the office supply purchase date back to August. Pruitt also asked EPA for an order of leather-bound notebooks, fountain pens and stationery, the New York Times reported.

Bad Wolves - Zombie (Lyrics):

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eighteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eight-teen
In your head, in your head, they're dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie,

Oh oh oh oh 
Ie-ie, oh

Lyrics

Main jado tere khaab an wale raah tureya
Main turreya bada na maithon jawein mudeya
O jive rehnde panne nal panne judd de
Main ravaan tere nal ohna waangu judeya

Main likhda hunda si tere baare adiye
Jaa ke puchle gawah ne taare adiye
Jo karde mazak ohna hass lainde
Jo taane kassde ohna nu kass lainde




Dil tainu rehnda sadda chete karda
Kise hor te na maare tere te hi marda
Ban meri rani tera raja ban jaan
Tu hi ban mera ghar darwaza ban jaan

O tainu vekh jaava tere val rudeya
Tu fool te main tahni wangu naal judeya

Main jado tere khaab an wale raah tureya
Main turreya bada na maithon jawein mudeya
O jive rehnde panne nal panne judd de
Main ravaan tere nal ohna waangu judeya

Layi na tu mainu bahute laare adiye
Ni hor kitte rehjiye kunware adiye
Mere supne bade ne keh lainde
Na bhejj main dur nede reh lai de

Ae pyar rahe pura na rahe thudeya
Main umraan tayi tere naal raha judeya

Main jado tere khwab an wale raah tureya
Main turreya bada na maithon jawein mudeya
O jive rehnde panne nal panne judd de
Main ravaan tere nal ohna waangu judeya

Aa kathe ho ke duniya bana laye
Rusiye je jagg hi mana laye
Choli teri khushiyaan naal bhar daunga
Supne aa wala tainu ghar daunga

Ae fikke nahi laare eh sahchi gudde aa
Tere lai ae haath Rabb agge judeya

Main jado tere khwab an wale raah tureya
Main turreya bada na maithon jawein mudeya
O jive rehnde panne nal panne judd de
Main ravaan tere nal ohna waangu judeya"

She says she believes he‚Äôs lying to her.

Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people.

The Dr. Phil show provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television. For over a decade, Dr. McGraw has used the show's platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the ""silent epidemics"" of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide and various forms of severe mental illness."

‚ÄúUS House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan will not run for re-election this year, in a big blow to Republicans with mid-term elections looming.

Congress' most powerful lawmaker said he would not stand for another term in his Wisconsin district this November.

Republicans already face a tough challenge from Democrats to keep control of the lower chamber.

Mr Ryan joins nearly 30 House Republicans who have announced this year they are retiring outright.

Democrats need 23 seats to take over the House.
In a Wednesday morning news conference, Mr Ryan said the decision was family-related.

""You all know that I did not seek this job,"" he said. ""I took it reluctantly.‚Äù*

It's often distressing to hear about the death of a famous actor. Their passings can evoke the feeling of an end to an era, as once-vital, charismatic performers head offstage for good after a final bow. These actors made us laugh, made us cry, and made us feel - and many of them seem like they're gone too soon. Let's remember some of the actors that we've lost in 2018...

Lyrics
OutKast- Hey Ya 

1, 2, 3, uh!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But ""got it"" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We've been together, oh, we've been together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyonc√©s and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

‚ÄúLawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. are demanding that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explain reports that political research firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, secretly used 50 million users‚Äô data.

‚ÄúI think he should explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were hurt, and most importantly how they‚Äôre going to fix it,‚Äù Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on CNN Tuesday.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who signed a bipartisan letter with Klobuchar seeking a judiciary hearing with Zuckerberg and other media CEOs, expressed particular concern with the social media site‚Äôs handling of user data. Reports this week say Cambridge Analytica, hired by Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign, improperly collected personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.‚Äù

Live it up.",kwiteryabitchin,24,2016-04-30T23:42:15.000Z,live it up|crocodile dundee|mick dundee|tranny|scene|1986|funny scene|he's australian|new york parety|paul hogan|Linda Kozlowski|Anne Carlisle,727450,1784,118,208,"Description""Crocodile"" Dundee is a 1986 Australian comedy film set in the Australian Outback and in New York City. It stars Paul Hogan as the weathered Mick Dundee. Hogan's future wife Linda Kozlowski portrayed Sue Charlton.

Inspired by the true life exploits of Rodney Ansell, the film was made on a budget of under $10 million as a deliberate attempt to make a commercial Australian film that would appeal to a mainstream American audience, but proved to be a worldwide phenomenon. Released on 30 April 1986 in Australia, and on 26 September 1986 in the United States, it was the second-highest-grossing film in the United States in that year and went on to become the second-highest grossing film worldwide at the box office as well.

There are two versions of the film: the Australian version, and an international version, which had much of the Australian slang replaced with more commonly understood terms, and was slightly shorter. Although the film was a hit both in Australia and abroad, it became controversial with some Australian critics and audiences‚Äìwho resented the image of Australian people as being ""redneck"" (or ""ocker""). Although this view has been largely put to rest, the uncultured ""larrikin bushman"" has been firmly entrenched in Australian-related pop culture.

Crocodile Dundee was followed by two sequels: Crocodile Dundee II (1988) and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001), although both films failed to match the success of the predecessor.

Anne Francine (August 8, 1917 ‚Äì December 3, 1999) was an American actress and cabaret singer. She is perhaps best known for her role as villain Flora Simpson Reilly in the American television series Harper Valley PTA.

Anne Francine began performing as a cabaret singer in the 1930s at the Coq Rouge. Other notable engagements included the Copacabana and the Algonquin. She sang abroad in London and Paris in the 1940s.

She made her Broadway debut in 1954 with Shirley Booth in By the Beautiful Sea. She stepped in for Bea Arthur as Vera Charles in the 1966 Broadway production of Mame, starring Angela Lansbury. She and Lansbury reprised their characters in the 1983 revival. Francine last appeared on Broadway in 1987 as Mrs. Harcourt in the Lincoln Center revival of Anything Goes, starring Patti LuPone.
In 1979, she starred as the Evil Queen in the musical adaption of the 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Her film work included Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits (1965), Stand Up and Be Counted (1972), Savages (1972), and Crocodile Dundee (1986)."

Fifth Avenue Lyrics:

You see when I was 18 I was lazy as sin
Smoking a Blunt no matter mood I was in 
It's a coming of age thing, born with a rage thing 
I knew I had to leave home. 

So I packed my big blue bag and I took off to New York, I got a one bedroom with a flag on the porch, I said, I‚Äôll see ya later, all ya alligators. Haha

It's like the forth of July when I'm living my life hanging with the mets and the Yankees every night, making my Dreams come true on Fifth Avenue. No more wasting my time or waiting for a sign, I got a bugoti and a lambo on my mind. Dreams come true on Fifth Avenue. 

This is the land of the great where you can shoot for the stars. 
All That i need is a break so I can play my guitar 
But the cities a jungle it's keeping me humble, man I'm so far from home. 
 
But I keep my train on the tracks cause I still want me some more, not just my name in lights I want the whole billboard. You'll see me in a while all ya crocodiles. Haha

Today we got our truck and turned it into a hot tub. How we did this was we got a tarp and put it into the back of the truck bed so the hot water wouldn't leak out. We have seen many people turning the back of their trucks into swimming pools but nobody has turned the back of their truck into a jacuzzi! We poured all the hot water into the truck bed during the snowy weather here and it was so warm and fun!

As the host of HBO'S Last Week Tonight, John Oliver has firmly established himself as a leading voice in late night with his unique brand of biting satire, stupid antics, and nuanced political commentary. Well, mostly nuanced. Following a three-month hiatus, Oliver made his triumphant return to television in the fifth season premiere of Last Week Tonight in February 2018. Let's take a moment to get to know this guy a bit better with some fascinating facts you may not know about John Oliver...

‚ÄúMaryland gubernatorial candidate Rich Madaleno aired a campaign ad Thursday on ‚ÄúFox and Friends‚Äù that ended with him kissing his husband in an attempt to ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù President Donald Trump.

In the ad, the Democratic candidate promises to ‚Äústand up to Donald Trump‚Äù and lists off things he‚Äôs done that ‚Äúalready infuriate‚Äù the President, such as supporting Planned Parenthood and a statewide assault weapons ban.

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the number one way I piss off Donald Trump and the Republicans?‚Äù asked Madaleno before turning to kiss his husband, Mark Hodge.

‚ÄúTake that, Trump!‚Äù he declared.

The White House has refused to acknowledge Pride Month for a second year in a row, and Trump instated a second ‚Äútransgender soldier ban‚Äù after the first attempt was shot down in the courts. Additionally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions applauded the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in favor of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.‚Äù

""A sheriff in Alabama took home as personal profit more than $750,000 that was budgeted to feed jail inmates ‚Äî and then purchased a $740,000 beach house, a reporter at The Birmingham News found.

And it's perfectly legal in Alabama, according to state law and local officials.

Alabama has a Depression-era law that allows sheriffs to ""keep and retain"" unspent money from jail food-provision accounts. Sheriffs across the state take excess money as personal income ‚Äî and, in the event of a shortfall, are personally liable for covering the gap.

Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin told the News that he follows that practice of taking extra money from the fund, saying, ""The law says it's a personal account and that's the way I've always done it.‚Äù‚Äù*

For the millions who tuned in to watch Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle, it was the chance to witness a real-life fairy tale as it was told. The charming prince defied expectations by wedding the American actress and divorcee, so it's probably not too surprising that some of the most memorable moments of the telecast were completely unscripted. From a few swoon-worthy gestures to some gutting emotional tributes, here are the royal wedding moments no one will forget...

The dogs we live and work with today have come a long way thanks to generations of evolution and breeding. Yes, it‚Äôs crazy, but whether we‚Äôre talking about that fiery little Chihuahua, that energetic Labrador Retriever or that super-fast Greyhound, all of our dogs originated from wolves a long time ago. In fact, archeologists have discovered human remains from thousands of years ago buried with the remains of a dog nearby. It turns out that man‚Äôs best friend has held that title for quite some time. Today, we use dogs for all sort of things. They entertain us, keep us company, hunt and retrieve, and even guard us. In fact, in terms of guard dogs, there are some pretty large breeds that are intimidating even to look at.
Yes, in the realm of dog-human interaction, the role of guard dog has been around for a long time. Guard dogs come in all shapes and sizes but they serve the same purposes ‚Äì to protect livestock, property or even the humans of their ‚Äòpack.‚Äô Ahead you‚Äôll see dogs like the Boerboel and Dogue de Bordeaux, two breeds used to guard homesteads and even the castles of the elite. Looking to protect livestock as well? Then be sure to watch for the Kangal and Fila Brasileiro. Both of these dogs aren‚Äôt only big but extremely loyal and intimidating. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and Tibetan Mastiff both originated in mountainous and harsh environments ‚Äì so you know these breeds are tough and mean business when they bark. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the Komondor. It may look like an oversized mop ‚Äì but if you try to mess with the herd it‚Äôs guarding it‚Äôll mop the floor with you. The same can be said of the Great Pyrenees. It may look like an oversized Golden Retriever, but this large dog will defend animals and people with great courage and loyalty. With a well-established history of protecting estates from wild dogs, the Perro de Presa Canario is one large breed we don‚Äôt think you should mess with. The same goes for the Caucasian Shepherd. This massive dog has evolved to meet the rugged environment of Southern Russia and the Caucasus, so you know it can hold its own when it comes to a fight. All in all, we‚Äôre pretty sure you don‚Äôt want to mess with any of these massive breeds.

In this DIY room decor tutorial I show 10 DIY projects on how to decorate your room. In this DIY room decorations video you won't just find room decor ideas for teenagers, but a complete room makeover project. Using these easy room decor ideas I transformed my room from plain and boring for cheap to absolutely stunning! In this DIY you'll find wall d√©cor ideas, furniture painting, DIY pillows and bunch of d√©cor ideas for your desk, table, night stand or a dresser. Tons of epic DIYS! These room d√©cor ideas are perfect for teenagers or children and can be used in a big or small room. I had so much fun decorating my bedroom and can't wait to share all these amazing room d√©cor DIYs projects with you.

http://sarabeautycorner.com/

We'll be making: 
- DIY Wall Decor, DIY Wall Art: DIY Garland out of paper flowers and DIY Painting with Acrylic Paints
- DIY Pillow, Smile Pillow, Chevron Pillow
- DIY Furniture painting - Drawers
- DIY Room decor ideas for your desk: DIY Pom Pom Flowers, DIY candles with crayons, DIY lamp with confetti butterflies, DIY colored sand for sand waves, DIY vase with colored stones, etc.

I start with furniture painting. In this room decorations video I show how to easily transform your plain furniture. I painted my drawers in pink and minty green and also added white dots all over for a true polka dots overload. I love how my new furniture itself made my small room so much more beautiful, while I haven't even started with the DIY room decor ideas! This DIY project is perfect for girls, teenagers or even children.

I also show how to create 2 kinds of DIY pillows (no sew) for my bedroom. Room d√©cor can't get any better than that! For the first DIY pillow decor I write a word smile on the pillow using yarn. On the second pillow I painted a pretty chevron pattern using blue and pink fabric paint. You basically need only a pillowcase and your creativity for this DIY!

In this DIY tutorial I also show several decor ideas for your desk, night stand or a dresser. One of these is a cactus with colored sand. You can buy already colored sand, or you can color it yourself using food coloring. This is such a fun and quick DIY decor idea and I love how it looks in the end. It also adds so much life to your teenage room.

Every room also needs a cute lamp, right? So in this decor tutorial I show how to make a cheap and pretty lamp using small butterfly confetti. Simply stick the butterflies all over the lamp and you get a beautiful colorful butterfly lamp. One of the cutest DIYs ever!

We all love candles, right? So let's DIY pretty personalized candles that are amazing to look at even when they are not burning. All you do is melt white wax together with a piece of crayon and pour the colored wax mixtures in the glass. Your room will get all cozy and beautiful in a second.

Another decorating idea of incorporating low maintenance plants into your room is a bamboo stick in a vase full of colored stones. Simply hold the bamboo in a vase and pour in layers of colored stones. I love this room decorating idea as it is so easy and brings so much life to any big or small room.

Next from the number of DIY projects in this tutorial are wall d√©cor ideas. First is a DIY paper flower garland which is so easy to make and gives a lot of color and texture to your wall. The second idea is an abstract painting with a word. I went for the word live for my wall art to remind me that we need to live every moment as if it was our last.

Last but not least I show you how to make a pretty pom pom flowers in a jar vase. This is such a cute decoration idea for your desk or a night stand... because who doesn't want to have a beautiful flower bouquet in their room all year around?

Let me know if you would like to see more room decor ideas, since I have many more DIY ideas for our big or small rooms :)

‚ÄúThe Pentagon is rolling out military hardware for a Fourth of July unlike any other. Tanks on the National Mall and military flyovers will be part of the capital's celebration, by order of President Trump. He'll be the first president to take an active role in any July Fourth ceremony in recent memory.

These flyovers cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, though military officials say they are essentially training flights and therefore not an extra cost to taxpayers. But the National Park Service is reportedly diverting nearly $2.5 million, originally intended for parks across the country, for the celebration.

""Certainly going to be more expensive than previous years. Anytime you get a presidential visit there are inherent security costs,"" said Mark Litterst of the National Park Service.

The National Park Service said on Tuesday it was still waiting for the run of show from the White House ‚Äì proof this is a show, one stage-managed by the president down to the placement of tanks and infantry vehicles and the sequence of military flyovers, reports CBS News' Major Garrett. The Fourth of July is typically nonpartisan and a tribute to America's founding documents and self-government. 
 
The event is being called is called a ""Salute to America"" but Mr. Trump has made it clear that  the military will be front and center. ""We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display ‚Äì brand new. And we're very proud of it,"" Mr. Trump said.‚Äù

Ripert also hosts the PBS show Avec Eric, frequently judges on Top Chef, and has authored several books. The chef is also known for his enduring friendship with Anthony Bourdain. It was Ripert who discovered Bourdain in his hotel room after he ended his own life on June 8th, 2018. The two had been friends for years, with Ripert making frequent appearances on Bourdain's shows No Reservations and Parts Unknown. Casual fans of Bourdain's work may be curious about Ripert's backstory and their friendship. Here are a few things you may not know about chef Eric Ripert...

Because of society and perceived gender roles, men are expected to be big and strong. This perception, plus a desire to be healthy and strong, has fueled the fitness industry to where you can‚Äôt turn a corner without seeing a gym or some sort of diet/weight-loss company. Not all men can step up to the plate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre any less masculine. Some may have their focus in other areas that help humanity while others may hit the gym. We are bombarded with commercials for things like Nutrisystem, Weight Watchers, and more. There are some special men who work as hard as they can to become some of the strongest men in the world. Whether they achieve that goal through weightlifting or bodybuilding, you can‚Äôt argue with those results. Because we as a society like to determine titles through competition, there are several ways to earn a title. There‚Äôs the World Strongest Man competition, which some of its most successful winners have taken the title multiple times. But some of these men don‚Äôt need a title, like Helmut Strebl, who is regarded as one of the most ripped people in the world.

In this video, you‚Äôre going to meet some of the strongest men in the world like Mariusz Pudzianowski, who has won the title five times. Who knows, perhaps learning about these strong men will inspire you to get stronger in whatever goal you have to achieve! There‚Äôs no doubt that these men put in their blood, sweat, and tears to achieve their results.

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand

Oh oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dow'ry

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh oh oh oh - and two by two my human zoo
They'll be
Running for to come
Running for to come
Out of the rain

Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Oh, oh, people can you hear me (oh, oh, people can you hear me)

Lyrics

The Chainsmokers- Closer

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older

For me it is very fun and relaxing to make slime videos with tide pods, chalk, paint balls, wax and crayons and listen to their crushing relaxing sounds for antistress, that's why today I came up with a visual video of asmr using the tire of my car to crush balloons, water bottles and listen to crunch very crunchy and that is oddly satisfying, after destroying it will be very satisfy and relax to use water for washing.

""(Reuters) - Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us Inc has been making $400 million in interest payments on its debt every year, largely due to its $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005. This week, it succumbed to its debt burden, leading to the biggest bankruptcy of a U.S. retailer since that of Kmart in 2004.

The largest U.S. toy retailer‚Äôs decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday took investors by surprise, given that the company faced no imminent debt maturities and had managed to overcome financial stress in the past by securing concessions from its creditors.

But the company‚Äôs ability to kick the can down the road had been exhausted. The bankruptcy filing was the culmination of an unsuccessful seven-month effort by Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us to find relief from its $5.2 billion debt pile, according to bankruptcy court filings and people familiar with the deliberations.‚Äù*

With their dazzling metallic colours and unique ways of flying they are truly jewels of the air. This film presents dragonflies as they have never been seen before. Fascinating close up shots take us into the world of these insects, which have lived on earth since the age of the dinosaurs. Spectacular super slow motion shots and elaborate computer animation uncover, for the first time, how dragonflies capture their prey at lightning speed while flying and how they mate in the air. Underwater photography reveals the development of the predatory dragonfly larvae while time lapse sequences show the emergence of the fully grown insect. However these amazingly colourful flying acrobats are in danger. The dragonfly's preferred habitat in and around water is rapidly diminishing, which, in Europe alone, has pushed around 80 species to the brink of extinction."

Lyrics
Frankie Valli- Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off You
I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
Oh pretty baby
Trust in me when I say

Which one do you think wins?

By how much?

We've always been really curious about braided line vs monofilament line, and there hasn't been any real distance tests that we've seen.

So we decided to do our own braid vs mono casting contest.

Note: to see the full braid vs mono blog, click here: 

https://www.saltstrong.com/fishing-tip/casting-braided-line-vs-monofilament-line/

For this casting contest, we kept the following the same:

1) exact same rod
2) exact same spinning reel
3) same lure (weight)
4) same pound test in the lines (10lb test)

The difference was the line diameter (which is one of the main reasons most fishermen believe that braid outcasts monofilament).

Check out the results.

Have you done any tests on braided line vs mono line?

Let us know in the comments.

The artist Lorde wrote this amazing song. We thought we'd pay tribute to it by performing it the most inefficient way possible!

Lyrics
Lorde- Royals 

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

it's been a holiday tradition round here to post a special video around this time of year, I've been too busy to do a fan voted top ten (SOON tho) so here is the ULTIMATE ARIN COMPILATION.

Basically, it's the first five Best of Egoraptor videos morphed into one marathon video with way smoother editing/pacing, all the old bad transitions and about an hour of fat cut out, remixed audio and re-rendered at a snazzy higher resolution.

I've wanted to do something like this for a while, it was cringe inducing to go back to the older videos especially the first one IT'S SO BAD why did anyone ever watch my Movie Maker era stuff.

There's also a sentimental value to this, when I posted Best of Ego 5 this past Spring I genuinely believed at the time that would be my last compilation ever. Now 8 months later not only am I still trucking along with a new home and two jobs (and little sleep) Best of Ego 6 is borderline a certainty for 2018...a year I wasn't that sure I would see at all

anyway hope y'all like this, enjoy the holidays and have a happy new year!"

If you've ever seen flowing water look frozen like glass... that's Laminar flow

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GET SMARTER SECTION

Personally, I find calculating Reynolds number to be quite difficult. 
It's done differently depending on what type of flow you have.  A pipe is calculated different than an airplane wing etc.
Some fluid dynamicists would tell you that it's an exact science. I personally feel that it's a bit subjective. 
The most difficult parameter to nail down in my humble opinion is the characteristic length.
It's pretty easy for pipes, you just measure the diameter... but wings, plates, vortices...get complicated quickly.


You'll notice in the video I refrained from saying anything like 
""Flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than XXX"" or 
""Flow is turbulent when Reynolds number is more than XXX"".
There are different schools of thought on this.  Typically the transition between laminar flow and turbulent flow occurs somewhere between 2100 and 4000 (Reynolds number is unitless).

Lyrics:

Give me a reason 
Why I should give a fuck
You lost my sympathy
You lack that human touch 
Too many secrets
Too many past mistakes
Discoloured memories
Stained by your fall from grace
You lost my sympathy
Another whisper
Another heart to break
Stained by your fall from grace

Let it sink don't swim
I was in too deep 
But I can't let you take another piece of me  
You can break me down
Little bit by bit
But I won't let you keep another piece of me

So tell me something
Why should I stitch these cuts
You brought me misery
You took my confidence
Too many bruises
Too many hits to take
A broken promise
Another scar to make
You brought me misery
Another whisper 
Another heart to break
Too many hits to take
Another scar to make 

I can't pretend
It's not the end
Please don't pretend
It's not the end 
I won't take this 
You lost my sympathy
I've had enough of this
Stand by your fall from grace

SUMMARY
- When you have an important level to pass or battle to win, and suddenly, completely out of the blue and at the most inopportune moment, there it is ‚Äì an ad. Just turn on the Airplane Mode on your phone and the problem is solved!  
- Every time you connect to¬†a¬†new Wi-Fi, your phone shows you dots instead of¬†the actual password letters on¬†your screen. But what if you need to quickly connect the other device to the certain source of Wi-Fi and you don't remember the password? There is the app called Wifi Password Show. 
- You can create your own texts for any occasion possible! Just go to Settings, choose Phone, then Respond with Text and voil√† ‚Äì here you can make your own personal message that will be sent to your contacts. 
- Turn on a Guest Mode! To switch it on, simply tap the¬†User icon¬†in¬†the top right corner of¬†the quick Settings panel. Then tap¬†Guest.
- If¬†you enter *#31# you will hide the number for all calls. If¬†you need it¬†just for one certain call, you can type #31# right before the number you‚Äôre calling. 
- Audio Timer will allow your device to turn off all the audio at a certain time. This is available only to iOS users, though, and takes only a couple of quick and easy steps. 
- Another one of the coolest features that your iPhone has ‚Äì taking photos while filming a video. This option is available for all the iPhone models from iPhone 5 and onward. 
- Tap the¬†Share¬†icon in¬†any app, choose¬†Android beam¬†from the list of¬†options, and then just put the devices together back-to-back. A couple more seconds and your mission has successfully been obtained. 
- If it is necessary, Android users can easily use keyboard or mice. This can be¬†very useful if¬†your display is¬†damaged or¬†if¬†you just need to¬†type a¬†lot of¬†text. All you need to do to¬†attach a¬†keyboard or¬†mouse to¬†your Android phone is¬†a¬†USB on-the-go cable. 
- ! The app is called Screen Lock ‚Äì Time Password and it will make your phone‚Äôs current time (or¬†any other option related to¬†time) its lock screen password. Just look at the clock and unlock your phone with the current numbers.

""Mitch McConnell is canceling all but a week of the Senate's traditional August recess, hoping to keep vulnerable Democrats off the campaign trail and confirm as many of President Donald Trump's judicial and executive branch nominees as possible.

The Senate majority leader said Tuesday that the Senate will only take a break for the first week of August because of ""historic obstruction"" by Senate Democrats and will stay in session the rest of the month. McConnell was under enormous pressure from his own caucus as well as the president to cancel as much of the recess as possible, but the majority leader also saw an opportunity to unite Republicans and annoy incumbent Democrats.""

We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

Well, the inevitable has finally happened -- Walmart Yodel Boy was on Ellen.

This episode is brought to you by NHTSA reminding us that if you‚Äôre texting you‚Äôre not driving.

They say the only certainties in life are death and taxes, but I think we can add cute kids who go viral meeting Ellen to that list.

After straight up DEMOLISHING the Internet over the last week thanks to his rendition of Hank Williams Sr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúLovesick Blues‚Äù getting memed left and right, Walmart Yodel Boy sat down with Ellen to talk about his country-singing dreams and more.

11-year-old Mason Ramsey also talked about his humbling beginnings -- ya know, like two weeks ago -- and how he performed at Walmart quote ‚Äú50,000‚Äù times because that‚Äôs the only store they‚Äôve got in his hometown of Harrisburg, Illinois.

Mason also revealed that his trip to LA to be on Ellen‚Äôs talk show was his first time on an airplane! Talk about going places.

And OF COURSE he couldn‚Äôt stop by Ellen without putting those pipes to work.

But that‚Äôs not even the best part! You know Ellen always has some kind of trick up her sleeve, so she surprised Mason by telling him that he‚Äôd be performing at the famed Grand Ole Opry in Nashville this weekend. Which OBVIOUSLY is a dream come true for him. And me too, to be honest.

On top of that, Walmart has also given Mason a $15,000 scholarship. Man, talk about a whirlwind couple weeks for Mason!

What do YOU think of Mason‚Äôs newfound fame? Think he‚Äôs country‚Äôs next big superstar? Hit the comments to get talking, and make sure you subscribe to Clevver while you‚Äôre at it. As always thank you for watching, I‚Äôm your host Emile Ennis Jr., we‚Äôll see you next time!

While we‚Äôre at it, you can click to the left to see Millie Bobbie Brown dance to Walmart Yodel Boy then click to the right to watch Cardi B perform ‚ÄúMoney Bag‚Äù on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.

In one tweet, Roseanne wrote, ‚Äúmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.‚Äù It was a reference to Valerie Jarrett, longtime adviser to President Obama, who‚Äôs African-American. Roseanne also accused billionaire George Soros, who‚Äôs Jewish, of being a Nazi collaborator and attacked Chelsea Clinton. The decision to cancel Roseanne was made by Channing Dungey, the first African-American president of a major TV network. The reboot of the hit 1980s sitcom Roseanne last year drew huge audiences and praise from President Trump, who once called Roseanne Barr to congratulate her on the show‚Äôs success. We speak with Glenn Greenwald in Rio de Janeiro.

Anthony Bourdain's Seafood Stew
Serves 4-6

1 bottle dry red wine 
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 green pepper, cut into ¬Ω-inch pieces
1 medium onion, cut into ¬Ω-inch pieces
7 to 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon cumin
1 stem fresh oregano, leaves removed
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
4 large octopus tentacles, cut into ¬Ω-inch pieces
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 (16-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 cups homemade octopus stock, or store-bought, low-sodium vegetable stock
2 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into ¬Ω-inch pieces
2 cod fillets (7to 8 ounces each), cut into 1-inch pieces
12 little neck or top neck clams, scrubbed
Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
French baguette, for serving

1. In a medium pot over medium heat, add wine.  Simmer until wine is reduced by two-thirds.
2. Heat oil a large, high-sided skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion, green pepper, and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add cumin, oregano, and pepper flakes, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add octopus pieces and cook until juices release, 1-2 minutes.  Pour reduced wine into pan; scrape bottom of pan using a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits.  Add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes and enough of the octopus stock to cover by 1 inch; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, and add the potatoes; gently simmer until tender, about 45 minutes.  
3. Add cod and clams, and cook, covered, until clams have opened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately, with bread alongside, or the following day...it's even better. 

Pulpo a la Gallega
Serves 4 

2 cups ham, cut into 1-inch pieces (Jamon de Bayon or Prosciutto)
3 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
¬Ω large onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 head garlic, cloves separated
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
3 tablespoons paprika, plus additional for garnish
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 (4 to 6 pound) whole octopus, beak removed and tenderized
Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
Sherry vinegar
1 lemon, sliced in half (optional)

Place ham, celery, onion, garlic, peppercorns, paprika, and parsley in a large pot of water.  Bring to a slow simmer over medium-low heat and cook for 1 hour.  After 1 hour, place the whole octopus in the stock and cook, uncovered, until completely tender or can be easily pierced with a sharp knife, 45 minutes to 1¬Ω hours.  Remove the octopus from the cooking liquid and set aside to cool.  

Remove tentacles from the head of cooled octopus, and slice into ¬Ω-inch pieces.  

Arrange octopus pieces in a round shape in the center of each plate.  Season with salt and pepper.  Garnish generously with paprika.  Drizzle with olive oil and a few drops of vinegar or lemon juice.  Serve immediately.

When it comes to giant retailers, Walmart is a cut above the rest. It is the largest private employer in the US. And its annual revenue is in the hundreds of billions. That‚Äôs the budget of a small European country.¬†But not everything is rosy for the large corporation. No company wants anything out there that would tarnish its image. So let‚Äôs uncover 10 Secrets Walmart Doesn't Want You To Know (Part 2).

TIMESTAMPS:
0:28 Owned by a Wealthy Family
1:49 Day-Old Bread is just as Yummy
3:00 Cheap Labor
4:24 The Sweet Dollar Deals
5:31 Walmart and the Cops
6:55 Free Shipping Obviously
7:58 Win the Price Wars
9:09 Seek the Coupons
10:26 It‚Äôs all in the Price Tag
11:50 New Parents get Free Stuff

SUMMARIES:
- The first fact about Walmart relates to the owners. Understandably this is one nugget the wealthy family wouldn‚Äôt like to get around. But it‚Äôs not exactly a secret that the Waltons own the large retailer which makes them the richest family in the world.
- That was a dark start. So let‚Äôs turn our attention to something that would benefit you if you shop at Walmart. It‚Äôs about bread. We all love the smell of fresh bread. But living in a city makes the chance of seeing fresh bread coming out of the oven as rare as spotting a unicorn strolling down Times Square.
- We‚Äôve talked before about big corporations running overseas sweatshops and sometimes utilizing child labor to cut down on costs and increase their profit. A quick Google search will yield plenty of scandals of this type. But what‚Äôs new here is that you don‚Äôt need to go overseas to find cheap labor.
- We mentioned that if you know where to look you can find a loaf of bread selling for one dollar at Walmart. Luckily there‚Äôs no cheap labor involved here and the low prices are part of a marketing campaign to attract customers.
- We all try to love and respect the police. From a distance, that is. Nobody likes to have a cop tailing them. On the road, a police car is always better ahead of you than behind you. This is not a reflection of a guilty conscience.
- This is one nifty trick that many people may not know about and will save you a lot of money and time while you‚Äôre shopping. If you like to shop online, you‚Äôll be pleased to know that Walmart delivers your purchases to your home free of charge.
- One of the best things about Walmart is that it allows you to keep the change on your coupon. Say you have a $10 coupon and you made a purchase for $8.35, that leaves you with $1.65. Walmart will let you keep that dollar, 65 cents and use it in future shopping.
- This is definitely a secret that Walmart wouldn‚Äôt want you to know about. It has to do with the price tag code the company uses. When you see a new item on the shelf such as a lamp or toaster, you might be tempted to buy it before it gets picked by other customers.
- This is definitely a secret that Walmart wouldn‚Äôt want you to know about. It has to do with the price tag code the company uses. When you see a new item on the shelf such as a lamp or toaster, you might be tempted to buy it before it gets picked by other customers. But that‚Äôs not usually a good idea.
- As we mentioned before, not all big corporations are evil. And not all their marketing strategies are aimed at snaring the customers and fleecing them. Certainly not this one, which is a good practice by the giant retailer.

""Fox News host Tucker Carlson is very angry about the reaction a Houston restauranteur got after posing for a photo with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The restaurant has apologized for a social media post in which it said it was an ‚Äúhonor‚Äù to serve Sessions.

Carlson had Univision anchor Enrique Acevedo on for a confrontational interview in which he accused the network of not being a news network and instead trying to ‚Äúpummel‚Äù the chef.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally opposed to illegal immigration. I think our legal immigration should be lower because the country is getting too volatile. Those are my sincere views,‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúShould I be allowed to eat Mexican food?‚Äù

Acevedo said that cultures should share and that Mexicans should share their food and culture with Americans.‚Äù*

The thesis of the talk I gave: Millennials don't exist and the entire idea of ""generations"" is unscientific, condescending, and stupid. For more misconception destruction, check out my show ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING on TruTV!

UPDATE: Since making this video, I've met Jean Twenge, who let me know that she felt I had misunderstood (and thus misrepresented) some of her research. I'm always eager to hear from an expert - which Jean genuinely is on this topic - so we sat down for a special episode of the Adam Ruins Everything podcast to talk about Jean's research on generations and my reservations about the term. Enjoy! http://www.maximumfun.org/adam-ruins-everything/adam-ruins-everything-episode-28-jean-twenge-and-adam-discuss-their-difference

I Don't Care - Lyrics

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
And you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (no)

I don't like nobody but you
It's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you
Baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you
Baby, yeah

'Cause I don't care (don't care) when I'm with my baby, yeah (oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (maybe I'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (with the bad nights)
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near (me near)
You can take me anywhere (anywhere, anywhere)
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody (I'm loved by somebody)

""Suzanne Scott, the new chief executive of Fox News, recently urged producers to place new scrutiny on the things hosts and panelists say during various shows, as the 21st Century Fox-owned outlet has come under a microscope after a recent string of controversial statements made on air.

In a meeting with New York and Washington-based producers, Scott cautioned the group to be more mindful of ‚Äúprotecting the talent, protecting the brand,‚Äù according to an account by Politico, which previously revealed the recent discussion. Scott, who was named CEO in May, is the only female executive overseeing a major U.S. TV-news operation.

‚ÄúAs the CEO of the network, Suzanne Scott regularly leads executive and editorial meetings and she expects accountability from her senior staff, which is what all good leaders do,‚Äù Fox News said in a statement.""

What are the consequences of royal inbreeding? Today we are going to look at the stories of the past, when royal inbreeding went horribly wrong. When we talk about inbreeding we are referring to reproducing with someone who is closely related in terms of genetics. We see this happen a lot when dogs are bred, and many people are critical of it. You see, when a pooches‚Äô mum and dad are not genetically related that puppy gets diverse genes. This is a good thing as if both were the same or similar and carried a faulty gene the puppy would also get that fault. With a mix, it has more choice and can override the bad gene. As one dog breeding website puts it, some inbred dogs are ‚Äúborn sick and die sick.‚Äù With that in mind, how does inbreeding bode for humans? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll find out today, in this episode of the Infographics Show, When Royal inbreeding went wrong.

""Australia. A Continent Adrift"" full documentary in which we discover how animals that populated this part of the supercontinent Gondwana have evolved as to what the Australian continent adrift in the ocean.

The story of the inhabitants of this Terra Australis can be traced back to the distant days when all the continents of the southern hemisphere were one. The world was then a warmer, and more humid place, in which enormous dinosaurs ruled over a zoology in permanent evolution. The remains of that universal jungle can still be seen in the north east of Australia, and are now home to the descendents of the long extinct dinosaurs. 

The birds are the most numerous species in this green, suffocatingly humid world.  Their ability to fly meant they were not condemned to isolation like the land creatures of Australia, and competition with the species from the rest of the world produced new types of bird, which then came to these Jurassic forests, and stayed forever.

In those distant forests, one hundred million years ago, there lived different types of mammals who sought to ensure their survival by using different means of reproduction.  The monotremes, the oldest of all, were mammals, but laid eggs; the eutherians gave birth to completely developed young; and the marsupials, somewhere between these two extremes, completed their development outside the mother‚Äôs body.  

The jungles of South America were, like those of Australia, once part of Gondwana.  Back then, monotremes, marsupials and eutherians coexisted in the primeval forests.  But the last of these three, little by little, gained ground, as their new evolutionary prototypes improved.  
The new mammals not only had placentas, they were also more intelligent, and they took over the majority of the habitats of the monotremes and the marsupials. But defeat was not quite as absolute as people tend to think.  Because, in the South American night, old ghosts from Gondwana still hide.

Everything began with a great journey across the Indian Ocean, millions of years ago.
This was just the beginning of the great marsupial adventure, a period of enormous changes. 
On its journey northwards, Australia became increasingly warm, and its jungles became smaller.  The climate of the island slowly changed.  The plants had to adapt or die. Each change in the climate meant a change in the vegetation, and each one of these was followed by an endless number of adaptations by the animals.  

And Australia continued moving north on its slow journey across the Indian Ocean.
The closer it came to the Tropic of Capricorn, the more temperate the climate became.  Where once there had been jungle, vast open plains appeared The pasture took over the land, and new colonists appeared, some of them close relatives of those who still now live hidden in the last remaining jungles of Australia.

The trees of the jungle were always a place of refuge and expansion for the marsupials.  As foliage became sparser, due to climate warming, they were forced to colonise the plains and grasslands.

The koala was able to colonise the eucalyptus forests thanks to an adaptation which would seem impossible ‚Äì the ability to feed on its leaves.  The leaves of the eucalyptus tree are a combination of low-quality food, indigestible material, and active poisons.  Any animal that could adapt and make use of these leaves would have absolutely no competitors.  And that is precisely what the koala did.
The koala is an example of the incredible versatility of adaptation of the marsupial mammals of Australia. 

The duckbill platypus is one of the three species of monotremes mammals that lay eggs, a shy animal which lives in some rivers in the east of Australia. The other two are echidnas the long-snouted variety in New Guinea, and this one, the short-snouted variety, which can be found throughout Australia.

Australia continues on its slow drift northwards, at a speed of six centimetres a year. 
At present, a narrow strait is all that separates the fauna of the  two continents.  But what will happen when the animals of Asia and Ocean√≠a come into direct contact?  There may well be enormous upheavals in the uncertain future of this continent.  It is easy to image that the evolution of its landscapes and animals will undergo far-reaching changes.  But, probably, when new, specialised creatures adapt to the unique conditions of these forests or deserts, causing many of the evolutionary prototypes that now dominate Australia to die out, in the farthest depths of the jungle, with their pacific and archaic way of life, there will continue to be echidnas and duckbill platypuses.  And, as in Gondwana in the distant past, there will continue to be mammals who lay eggs."

Find out why the ‚ÄúWalmart Yodel Boy‚Äù meme is BLOWING UP the Internet!

This is the meme Twitter never knew it needed, but now can‚Äôt live without... 

Okay before we go any further, you guys need to watch this video of a kid yodeling at a Walmart, which has gone viral for reasons too obvious to mention:

And you thought YOUR hobbies were unique. 

The adorable boy in the video is Illinois resident Mason Ramsey, and this is not the first time he‚Äôs yodeled at a Walmart. It turns out, Mason is pretty well known in the town of Harrisburg for dressing up in his finest shirt, cowboy boots, and bow-tie, and yodeling his little heart out at the town‚Äôs local Walmart. The song he‚Äôs singing in the video is Lovesick Blues by Hank Williams, and thanks to his impressive vocals, perfect tempo, and stand-out style, Twitter is OBSESSED with him.  

And where there is a Twitter obsession, there are hundreds of follow-up memes...

The reactions to Mason‚Äôs yodeling video were absolutely hilarious, with one user Tweeting QUOTE, ‚Äúsomewhere father john misty is watching the walmart yodel boy SHAKING‚Äù. 

While comedian Elijah Daniel joked, ‚Äúyodeling kid in walmart is the new lil pump‚Äù. 

One user Tweeted the question, ‚ÄúHow could you even watch the walmart yodel boy?‚Äù with the following video as their answer:

Okay name a more iconic mashup than those cheerleaders dancing to Mason‚Äôs yodeling. I‚Äôll wait.

The reaction tweets and memes got so out of hand, that one person dubbed Mason‚Äôs voice into a Sims game‚Ä¶.

TWEET: https://twitter.com/100dollajill/status/980297631351169024 (0:00-0:07)

While someone else dubbed Mason‚Äôs yodeling into the dance scene from ""Call Me By Your Name"" to create the sensational parody, ""Yodel Me By Your Name"".

Somehow I just know that Armie Hammer would DEFINITELY approve of this. 

And we can‚Äôt let you guys go without showing you another video of Walmart Yodel Boy‚Äôs talents:

MY HEART

Okay guys now it‚Äôs time for you to let me hear YOUR reactions to Walmart Yodel Boy aka Mason Ramsey--do you think he should be the next guest on The Ellen DeGeneres show? Cuz I do!

Today we share a compilation of funny kitchen moments that are familiar to everyone. Do you love cakes so much that sometimes don‚Äôt want to share with anyone? Just cut a small piece for your friend and eat the rest by yourself. 
If you borrow a chocolate bar from your brother or sister without asking, leave the note ‚ÄúSorry! Hunger made me to do it!‚Äô‚Äô. This will be a funny way to excuse.
Anyone hates to share the food especially when you can order anything in restaurant. Girls, do you eat your boyfriend‚Äôs food?) Sharing is caring? üòâ
Do you love ice cream? Check out our video and make black ice cream at home? Sounds interesting? The main idea is to use charcoal! It‚Äôs super popular trend now to use charcoal while cooking and for many other things like detox and masks! Mix heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal in a large bowl. Beat the mixture and add dry rice, mix again. Enjoy!
The next recipe will totally surprise you! Vegan caviar! Don‚Äôt you believe us? Here is a brilliant recipe that will amaze your family and friends. Firstly, pour water into the pan, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Take a tall glass and fill with vegetable oil and put into the fridge. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Once the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out small drops of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. You may decorate with this vegan caviar any dish and even cakes!
As a bonus, we share with you a trick to surprise your friends: put strawberry into bleach to remove the color. Now you can prank your friends using a white strawberry. But don‚Äôt eat these strawberries!

Lyrics 
Tom Petty- You Don't Know How It Feels

Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
Let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I gotta go
And you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me
My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I got a little space to fill
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
Let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I gotta go
And you don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me

Summary:
We real life tested actual scenes from three Christmas classics in a replica of the Home Alone house:

1) A Christmas Story- Can you really shoot your eye out with a Red Ryder BB gun?
2) Elf- What happens if you actually get hit with a snowball at 95 mph?
3) Home Alone- What really happens if you put a blow torch on your head for 7 seconds?

The winner got to keep the awesome leg lamp and the loser had to wear Ralph's pink bunny suit

Lyrics 
Khalid- Young Dumb & Broke

So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
Jump and we think, leave it all in the game of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. http://www.tytnetwork.com/join

Read more here: https://www.mediaite.com/tv/eric-trump-hits-obama-over-russian-meddling-why-did-he-do-nothing/

""So let‚Äôs get this straight, Eric Trump‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been proven that President Donald Trump didn‚Äôt win the 2016 election because of Russian meddling, Democrats now have egg on their faces because they tried to insist that was the case, and Barack Obama should have done something about the Russian meddling in the first place, because he knew about it?

That appears to be Eric‚Äôs line of argument in his visit to Fox & FriendsMonday morning.

‚ÄúWhat started off as a hoax ‚Äì you know, Trump won the election because of Russia ‚Äì has been proven to be nothing further from the truth,‚Äù Eric said. ‚ÄúAnd [Dems] ended up finding themselves in this whole irony. It‚Äôs just kind of amusing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the Russians being bold enough to meddle has to be stopped,‚Äù Brian Kilmeade replied.‚Äù*

Why did the community react to Gun Goddess Miss Fortune with disappointment rather than hype? Why did Riot seem to be apologizing for her quality even before she was released? Why did a cool, badass, fully-featured, high-quality skin end up talked about a low point in the Ultimate skin line?

How did Riot paint themselves into a corner? The same way everyone else does, eventually. Let's talk about that.

Nowadays, Australia seems to be immune to any sort of financial crisis. The last time it entered a recession was when Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union. 

But, how is this possible? Well, in this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you all about it!

When people are deciding what age to have children at, you‚Äôll often hear them say that before they have kids there are a lot of things they want to get done first. Maybe travel the world, maybe concentrate on a career, or at least just wait until the twenties are out of the way. On the flip side, some people will tell you that they want to have children at a young enough age so that they can actively play sports with their children when the kids are in their teens, adding that they don‚Äôt want to be ageing parents because they fear they won‚Äôt have the energy required, say, in their 50s, to still be dealing with kids. Today we‚Äôll talk about all the pros and cons, in this episode of the Infographics Show, Is it better to be born to younger or older parents?

Lyrics 
Jason Derulo- Want to Want Me

It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave yeah
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, ""Baby I'm yours""
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
So high
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you
Just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high
Oh just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
I would do anything
Just to get up next to you
Anything and everything
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

‚ÄúDonald Trump is replacing National Security Adviser HR McMaster with former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton in the latest administration shake-up.

‚ÄúGeneral McMaster‚Äôs leadership of the National Security Council staff has helped my administration accomplish great things to bolster America‚Äôs national security. He helped develop our America First National Security Strategy, revitalize our alliances in the Middle East, smash ISIS, bring North Korea to the table, and strengthen our nation‚Äôs prosperity‚Äù, Mr Trump said in a statement.

The President said on Twitter that a ‚Äúformal handover‚Äù would occur in April.

‚ÄúI am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor. I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests‚Äù, Mr McMaster said in a statement.‚Äù

Throughout this time, both countries have established one of the most fruitful, controversial and interesting relationships in the entire planet.
 
Economic relations are very important for Australia: today China is by far its largest trading partner; 1 out of every 20 inhabitants of this country belongs to the Chinese community and both its universities and beaches are packed with students and tourists from the Asian giant. Thanks partly to all this, Australians have not experienced a crisis in almost 30 years.
 
However, these growing ties clash with Washington‚Äôs interests, and in 2017 the Australian government decided once and for all to take sides. Since then, a diplomatic storm has been unleashed and Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has not refrained from blaming the Chinese intelligence services for wanting to corrupt Australian politics and society. In this video we‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs happening in this particular cold war, that is beginning to emerge between China and the United States.

Lyrics :

Ik dil da khaawb adhura ea
Baapu di tahur bnauni aa
Ohde sirr te aish main badi keeti
Hun baapu nu aish krauni aa

Paa ke chitta kurta baapu
Pind ch gedi maarya kar
Vekh shareekan vall baapu
Khundiya mushan nu chaadya kar
Landi jeep vi tere layi ik
Moge ton banvauni aa
Tere sirr te aish.......

Laa laa shiftan ethe baapu
Putt tera janda akkya
Saari umar kamaunda baapu
Tu mere layi naa thakkya
Kaali ghodi tere layi ik
Zire ton mangvauni aa
Tere sirr te aish.....

Kehda mera supna baapu 
Jo tu kade pugaya na
Tere ford badaulat he ajj
Beemran (BMW) tak main aya haa
Laike fortuner apa 
Vehde vich khadauni aa
Tere sirr te aish.......

Farmtrac apne nu hun 
Pakka e karde khada baapu
Aidhar aa ik putt apne naal
Selfie khicha lai zra baapu
Karke sandhu nu tag 
Te apa facebook te pauni aa
Tere sirr te aish main badi keeti
Hun tainu aish karauni aa.........

Bapu Nu Aish Kroni Aa
Baapu Nu Aish Kroni Aa
Bapu Di Tor bnani hai
bapu di taur"

The International Space Station - ISS - circles the earth at 240 miles above the planet, on the edge of space in low earth orbit. The station is crewed by NASA astronauts as well as Russian Cosmonauts and a mixture of Japanese, Canadian and European astronauts as well.

Please Standby mode (Bluescreen) 
The signal is temporarily lost from the international space station, live on UStream.tv

The ISS passes into the dark side of the earth for roughly half of each of its 90-minute orbits. As the Space Station passes into a period of night every 45 mins video is unavailable - during this time, and other breaks in transmission recorded footage is shown when back in daylight earth will recommence. As seen from the Nasa ISS live stream on the International Space Station - 
A real astronaut view of Earth! Captured by ISS HDEV cameras on board the International Space Station.

""Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) appeared on MSNBC for an interview with Katy Tur in which he dished on the difficulties of supporting President Donald Trump as a Republican.

Costello, who backed Trump in 2016 and recently announced he would retire rather than seek reelection in a tough upcoming election, has railed against the current political environment that focuses on Trump scandals over policy.

The Pennsylvania Republican told Tur about the difficulty, in a competitive seat, of catering to both Republican voters ‚Äî who want Trump to be defended at all costs ‚Äî and Democrats ‚Äî who demand answers on the latest presidential controversy.

Tur grilled Costello on why he supported Trump in 2016, given what he knew about his temperament, before asking, ‚ÄúDo you regret that now?‚Äù‚Äù*

But the timing of McCain's absence ‚Äì and return in time to heap praise upon Biden ‚Äì raised eyebrows at the show because the days off conspicuously coincided with the news that her father-in-law, Doug Domenech was among six Trump Administration appointees under investigation for ethics violations.

When he was just a teenager, he moved to London to pursue his music career, and his outpouring of creativity added up to hundreds of live shows. Getting a lot of attention with his online performances, Sheeran hit No. 1 on the iTunes chart before he ever signed with a record label. 

Since signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records, had a song appear in the second installment of The Hobbit and won a Grammy for Song of the Year, ""Thinking Out Loud.""

On the release day of Sheeran‚Äôs new album ‚ÄòDivide‚Äô, it streamed a world record thirteen million times on Spotify. The twenty six year old Englishman is in a league of his own."

Summary:  I made a bowling ball with James Bruton where it will steer left and right depending on how you lean.  People lean anyways when the bowl to try and influence the direction so we just capitalized on that.  It operates on the same principles of a BB8 ball.

Here's the number of super useful recipes of handmade makeup items, not only they look great but also taste delicious! And not to mention, the positive effect on your skin! Give it a try! 

1. DIY lipstick with dry flowers
Probably you've already seen a stunning transparent lipstick that has recently gone viral. Don't buy it, DIY it! 
Take any transparent or semi-transparent lip balm and microwave it for 30 seconds. Place a dry flower inside a lipstick container and pour the balm inside. Let it cool down for 2 hours. Done! Lovely DIY lipstick is done and you didn't spend a dollar on it :)

2. Repair broken press powder
Have you broken your compact powder? Don't worry, don't throw it away - use our awesome life hack instead! Pour some alcohol and remove excess liquid with a paper towel. Press the powder with a coin and let it dry overnight. Great job! Your broken compact powder looks like new again!
This trick works with any powder makeup: powders, blushes, eye shadows and highlighters.

3. How to make a lip stain
DIY lip stain is a great solution for busy women who want their lipstick to stay put all day long. But don't waste your money on it! You can easily make it at home. Take some nontoxic school glue and mix it with a few drops of food coloring of your choice. Apply it on your lips with a lip brush and let it dry for 10 minutes. Now peel off the glue. Lovely! Now you have bold colored lips that will come off only in the end of the day.

Bapu Tera Putt Nikama, Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e,
Bapu Tera Putt Nikama, Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e.
Aaye Din Pange Punda Si,
Jehda Nitt Ulame Leaunda Si,
Uth Tadke Job Nu Jave, Aa Roti Aap Pakwe,
Aape Hi Tadke Lave ,Bahla Hi Saau Ho Gaya e,
Bapu Tera Putt Nikama Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e (2)


Ik wje Dupehre Uthda Si, Tere Sir Te Aisha Karda Si,
Manje Te Roti Khanda Si, bhande Na Chuk K dharda Si,
Janda College Bann Sexy,Aa Shami Job KFC,                                                                Fir Raat Chalaunda Taxi ,Mehnat Diya Khau Ho Gaya e,
Bapu Tera Putt Nikama, Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e (2)


Do wje Raat Nu Aake Jadd, O Chonke De Vich Wadhda e,
Bebe Di aundi Yaad Jado, fulka Thalde Da hath Sadhda e,
Jadd yaad Bebe Di Aawe , Fir Na Peeve Na Khave,
Hadd wangu Neer wahave , Gall Dil Te Laau Ho Gaya e,
Bapu Tera Putt Nikama, Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e (2)


O Hundi e Jehdi Lambi Jehi, Kishta Te Le Ley Gaddi e,
Chaudariya De Ghar Naalo, Tere Putt Di Baithak Wadi e,
Weekend Te Disc v Jaave, Goreyan Naal bhangre Pave,
Manak Diya Kaliyan Gave, Naale ghutt ghutt Laau Ho Gaya e,
Bapu Tera Putt Nikama Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e (2)
 

Nahin Mithi Jail Vich Reh Hunda , Tere Kulwant Garae Ton,
2 Lakh Ajje Par Modhna e, Jehda Leya Udhara Taaye Ton,
Jedda Baar Baar Si Karda ,Ghar Jand Nu Hokke bharda,
Nahin Bapu De Bin Sarda , Sabb Nu Samjau Ho Gaya e,                                       Bapu Tera Putt Nikama Hunn bada Kamau Hoga e (2)

Summary:  I saw this video on Twitter and YouTube recently of a guy who modified his phone case with propellers.  Having a background in engineering it was pretty clear to me that it wasn't real but it seemed like most people believed it.  This was especially irksome give that he was selling the items in the desc using affiliate links.  So I did a deep dive on every last possible clue proving it was fake.

Lyrics 
Ed Sheeran- Shape of You

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

**Since a lot of you are asking, Wendy is using this specific metal detector: 
(Amazon Affiliate Link: https://amzn.to/2BLPu8Y). 

Please do note that we are not sponsored by bounty hunter.**

Episode Synopsis: 

Wendy, she's a new-comer, arrived and joined the team this late August. 

She doesn't have her own exploration team since nobody invited her into the island, she just brought herself into the island on her own research and connections.

And since she feels comfortable with our woman-majority team, we just invited her to join in.


Some facts about us and the island:

Based on local folklore, the island is pretty much just a big active volcano that last erupted some 370 years ago. This is a fact and verified based on historical records. 

But what remains a folklore is the story that the volcano slew some molten gold on its main outlet, together with what they called, the hardglass, which is believed to be diamonds by the prospectors.

This same story is known throughout the island and possibly the whole country. but very few believe this, and the government seems to be hiding this to harvest the gold ores after they get rid of the rebels.

Team Update:
Zoey (Filipino) ~ Still at her home country (probably busy enjoying her finds). No updates for her return, although she still request for our footages for her version of the documentary series.

Thea (Ukrainian)  ~ We both went back to the island together. Episode 4 will be pretty much Thea's since she pushed it to be early to show our best finds of the series.

Wendy (South African) ~ New girl on team. Has knowledge on refining the nuggets.

Robb (Trumplandia) ~ Just enjoying each and every second on the island. The narrator guy for episode 1, 3 and this episode 4

Lyrics
Khalid & Normani- Love Lies

Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
If you're down, don't hide it
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Tell me, are you down?
If you're down, don't hide it (yeah)
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it (yeah)
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Tell me, are you down? (Tell me)
Tell me where your love lies (tell me where your love lies)
Waste the day and spend the night (waste the day, spend the night)
Underneath the sunrise (underneath the sunrise)
Show me where your love lies (tell me where your love lies)
Tell me where your love lies (show me where your love lies)
Waste the day and spend the night (yeah, yeah)
Underneath the sunrise (ooh)

""In 1984, a Russian √©migr√© named David Bogatin went shopping for apartments in New York City. The 38-year-old had arrived in America seven years before, with just $3 in his pocket. But for a former pilot in the Soviet Army‚Äîhis specialty had been shooting down Americans over North Vietnam‚Äîhe had clearly done quite well for himself. Bogatin wasn‚Äôt hunting for a place in Brighton Beach, the Brooklyn enclave known as ‚ÄúLittle Odessa‚Äù for its large population of immigrants from the Soviet Union. Instead, he was fixated on the glitziest apartment building on Fifth Avenue, a gaudy, 58-story edifice with gold-plated fixtures and a pink-marble atrium: Trump Tower.‚Äù*

Will it be the nerds or will it be the kids that were popular in school? Does it matter what kind of student you are?

Like it or hate it, school has a social pecking order for most people. From grade school to high school, students form social groups or cliques, and some are more popular than others. While many students are lost somewhere in the middle in terms of popularity, the students at the top and at the bottom stand out the most. 

There are the high status popular kids who are often seen as the ideal everyone else strives for, and then there are the social misfits at the bottom who are often shunned lest their undesirable attributes rub off on anyone else above them.

Technology - and American cultural norms - have changed at such a blindingly fast pace that we sometimes forget just how weird the world used to be. Things that were once commonplace seem strange today, although it's probably also true that humans who live 100 years in the future will think the things we do are pretty strange too. Sadly, we don't have any way to actually show a 22nd-century person a YouTube video of someone eating a Tide Pod. But we can at least enjoy our own bemusement at the strange and bizarre habits of our recent ancestors...

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke."""

On this episode of Coyote‚Äôs Backyard, the team sets off to explore the tide pools of Southern California with fans Aiden and Dylan in an attempt to build an amazing tide pool aquarium!

Building a tide pool aquarium can be a fun way to spend the afternoon along the shore while searching for sea creatures. All you need is a small plastic container, some fresh sea water, and a keen eye to spot the well camouflaged marine life beneath the surface. While often challenging to find more than a couple species in a day this activity can be a fun way to learn about different marine habitats and all the cool animals that call them home.  

Get ready, we‚Äôre about to build one awesome aquarium!

In this back to school life hacks & DIY school supplies video I show 12 simple school hacks. These DIY school hacks for girls and boys are perfect for middle school but also college students. I included school morning routine hacks, food hacks, DIY edible school supplies, school pranks and other studying life hacks that will make your school days easier and exciting.

Food hacks! If you're making a bagel for your school lunch, instead of storing it in a usual plastic box, place it in an empty CD container. It fits perfectly and your bagel will remain fresh and perfect even if you throw it in your school bag.

Have you highlighted something you don't really want to? No problem! All you need is a bit of lemon juice. This school life hacks is absolutely mind-blowing and magical. Soak a q-tip in a bit of lemon juice and gently rub it over the highlighted area! The highlighter will disappear like magic.

Back to school studying hacks! If you love to study, write essays or reports on your bed or couch, this school simple life hack is perfect for you. Use a clothes hanger to clip your notebook, worksheet or a textbook to your PC and say goodbye to back and neck aches for good!

DIY edible school supplies and school pranks! If you are sleepy or bored during a lesson, a little sugar can make all the difference! But since candy and food in general are usually not allowed during lessons, we have to be a bit more sneaky. I show you how to make a DIY eos lollipop! You can keep it in your DIY pencil case and have it always on hand for the moments when you need a little sugary pick me up.
  
DIY school supplies hacks! Why having a boring metal stapler pins when we can have beautiful colorful instead. All we need are stapler pins and nail polish! This is such an affordable and inexpensive school hack for girls and boys that like some color in their life.

School morning routine hacks! Every second counts when getting ready for school in the morning. If you want to rock a neat and cool cat eyeliner every day a great hack is to use a pencil as a stamp. Cut the eraser and make a triangle shape.

Rainbow highlighters! Rainbow highlighters hacks have been allover YouTube recently and I really wanted to try them out. All you need are two or more highlighters and you can have so much fun! I tried the color changing highlighter hack and it worked perfectly. You should definitely try it too.

Some of us love listening to music while studying because it makes us more relaxed and helps us to concentrate. But teachers will probably not let you listen to music during the class. No problem! I show you a fun and sneaky way to listen to your favorite songs without anyone noticing.

DIY stamps for back to school! Stamps are always so much fun and make taking notes a super exciting task. All you need to make your own is a bottle lid and a piece of foam paper. Have a lot of fun stamping!

Sometimes you just want some peace and time for yourself. If you don't want to be bothered by people around, use this simple life hack. Put on your headphones and I guarantee ‚Äì people will be way less likely to bother you since they'll think you're listening to music! Works wonders at home, on the bus, plane or school. 

I love using sharpies and markers as they come in so many different colors. However if you use them to write in a notebook, the color bleeds through the pages, which can be pretty annoying. The solution is nail polish. Apply one layer on the paper and you can use your sharpies and markers without bleeding.

Writing to-do lists is essential if you want to keep organized in school or at work. Instead of writing to do lists in notebooks or your cell phone, you can write them on a mirror. Just make sure to use whiteboard markers!

Hope this school hacks will make your days at school easier and so much fun :)

Lyrics:

Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.""

Ayon kay Ailyn may naging babae ang kanyang mister at handa na siyang iwan ang kanyang asawa at susuport na lang sa mga anak.

Hindi naman ito naging hadlang para kay Idol na kumbinsihin si Ailyn na bigyan pa ng isa pang pagkakataon ang pagsasama nila ng mister. Panoorin ang kanilang pag-uusap.

Huwag po kayong magpost ng inyong comments na gusto ninyong makatulong o nagtatanong kung paano kayo makakatulong sa mga complainant na nasa video. Marami na po kaming natatanggap na reklamo tungkol sa mga taong nagbibigay ng maling impormasyon o nagpapanggap na staff ng Raffy Tulfo in Action para makapanloko. Kung nais po ninyong tumulong sa mga taong nasa video, magsadya lamang po kayo o magpadala ng representative sa TV5 Media Center at para personal na iabot sa mismong mga taong gusto ninyong matulungan.

Summary:  I customized my car horn to play three different sounds.  The main sound is the ""Courtesy Honk"" which is used to get the attention of other drivers in a non-emergency scenario.  It's two quick chirps of the horn that is not only friendly sounding, but it's not as loud as a normal car horn.

üé¨ Movie Credits:
Starring: Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif
Director: Ali Abbas Zafar
Producer: Aditya Chopra
Music: Vishal and Shekhar
Lyrics: Irshad Kamil
Director of Photography: Marcin Laskawiec, USC
Release Date: 22 December 2017

Synopsis:
Inspired by real events, Tiger Zinda Hai is a sequel to the blockbuster Ek Tha Tiger, and an espionage action drama that follows a daring rescue mission in Iraq.

When a group of Indian and Pakistani nurses are held hostage in Iraq by the militant Abu Usman, Indian intelligence (RAW) tracks down the reclusive agent Tiger 8 years after he fled with former Pakistani intelligence (ISI) agent Zoya. Joining forces in the name of humanity, Tiger and Zoya lead a team of RAW and ISI agents to covertly enter the hospital where the nurses are trapped, and get the nurses to safety before an American airstrike blows up the hospital.

Tiger Zinda Hai is an all-out entertainer with gritty action, music and drama.

""Donald Trump is deliberately forcing millions of Americans into financial ruin, cruelly depriving them of food and other basic protections while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy, the United Nations monitor on poverty has warned.


A journey through a land of extreme poverty: welcome to America
 Read more
Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur who acts as a watchdog on extreme poverty around the world, has issued a withering critique of the state of America today. Trump is steering the country towards a ‚Äúdramatic change of direction‚Äù that is rewarding the rich and punishing the poor by blocking access even to the most meager necessities.

‚ÄúThis is a systematic attack on America‚Äôs welfare program that is undermining the social safety net for those who can‚Äôt cope on their own. Once you start removing any sense of government commitment, you quickly move into cruelty,‚Äù Alston told the Guardian.""

TAEKWONDO LYRICS:

VERSE 1

I LEARNT GUITAR JUST TO PLAY YOU THIS SONG
I TOOK FRAN√áAIS JUST TO GIVE YOU LE MONDE
I'D JACK YOU A CAR EVEN THOUGH IT'S WRONG
WA OH WA OH
I'LL PEEL YOU A GRAPE AND I FEED YOU PRAWN
I BAKE YOU A CAKE AND I WATER YOUR LAWN
I'LL USE THE CRUMMY PADDLE WHEN WE PLAY PING PONG
WO OHH

PRE

DON'T YOU EVER WORRY BOUT A THING
DON'T YOU EVER WORRY BOUT A THING
CAUSE IMMA GONNA GIVE YA EVERY TING EVERYTHING
I GOT YOUR BACK

CHORUS

I TAKIN TAE KAON DO
IF PEOPLE MESS WIT YOU I'LL KICK‚ÄôEM WITH MY TOE.
I GOT THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL
YOU KNOW I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR LIFE LONG BEAU
I SAY I SAY

VERSE 2

I GREW YOU SOME KALE CAUSE YOU DON'T EAT MEAT.

VERSE 3

 IMMA BREAK IT DOWN IN THE RAP PART
CAUSE YOUR MY HALF HEART,
THE POEM IN MY HALLMARK 
CARDIAC ARREST WILL HIT THE CHEST 
 OF ANY MAN WITH WILLINGNESS TO MESS WITH MY MISTRESS 
I WILL THROW A KICK TO YOUR VOICE BOX
MY TIGER CLAW WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF
ANY TOUGH CHAP WHO WANTS A DEATH SCRAP 
WILL BE LYING FLAT ON THEIR BACK IN A DIRT NAP!

Lyrics 
Taylor Swift- I Knew You Were Trouble

Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

From a low-budget show on TruTV to a globe-circling phenomenon, Impractical Jokers is this century's little comedy show that could. Compulsively watchable and impossible to watch at the same time, the good-natured cringe comedy stars lifelong pals Joe Gatto, James ""Murr"" Murray, Brian ""Q"" Quinn, and Sal Vulcano, who grew up performing comedy together in Staten Island, New York. Together, the four produce and act out some of the best grown male buffoonery you can find on television today.  From their original intentions for the show to the most angry mark they ever pranked, here's the facts you didn't know about Impractical Jokers‚Ä¶

""A reporter asked Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) if he agrees with Donald Trump‚Äôs claim that the president can pardon himself. Then there was a long period of silence.

Trump tweeted on Monday that he has the ‚Äúabsolute right‚Äù to self-pardon, after internal White House legal strategy memos leaked to the New York Times, echoing expansive, Nixon-like views of executive power. The idea that a president can pardon himself is heavily disputed among legal scholars.

The Weekly Standard‚Äôs Haley Byrd asked Cruz if he agreed with Trump‚Äôs interpretation, and reported that it took 18 seconds and a second reporter repeating the question for Cruz to finally say, ‚ÄúThat is not a constitutional issue I have studied, so I will withhold judgment at this point.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the audio of the exchange here. It‚Äôs worth listening to.""

How does a psychopath compare to a sociopath? 

Do you have an exalted sense of self? Are you a compulsive liar? Would you do just about anything to get you want? If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to all of these questions, you might want to consult a professional who can determine if you are a sociopath or a psychopath. Both sociopaths and psychopaths share three common traits suggested by the questions above ‚Äì conceitedness, deceitfulness, and manipulation largely unchecked by moral conscience. Some experts think sociopathy and psychopathy are the same and group them together under the diagnostic term antisocial personality disorder or APD, while others argue that there are significant differences between the two mental disorders. We will examine some of these differences in this episode of The Infographics Show, ‚ÄúSociopath vs. Psychopath.‚Äù

We failed in 6 different ways before eventually getting it just right.  My friend Destin came and helped out and shot some amazing high speed shots on his nice Phantom camera.

Founders:Allan Johnston & Alan Morris
Writers:Allan Johnston & Alan Morris

Soon after Hoges appeared on US television screens, Australia became a must-see destination. Within three months, it rocketed from No.78 on the most-desired holiday list for Americans to No.7. Arrivals doubled over the first three years and for four years the growth rate was more than 25 per cent annually.

Bill Baker, a branding expert who co-managed the campaign in the US for its duration from 1984 to 1990, said the ad is still ""top of mind"" for many Americans.

""No Aussie tourism campaign has come close to matching it,"" he said. 

The campaign, launched at a National Football League game in Los Angeles in January 1984, and was so succsessful  because for the first time it went beyond Australia's known attributes of wildlife, outback and Great Barrier Reef.

""It engaged Americans on an emotional level, inviting them to immerse themselves in the relaxed Australian lifestyle. It used friendliness, the Australian accent and a cheeky sense of humour."""

Why don't the prices ever seem to increase for new games even the game development of indie and triple A (AAA) game has gone up so much? Do we now live in the world of microtransactions where games like Fortnite Battle Royale are offered free but make millions of dollars in selling cosmetic things? Should games for PC be costing the same as games for Xbox and PS4? Will the price shift to match more games without campaigns like PUBG?

""The House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused each other Tuesday of trying to intimidate State Department officials called as witnesses in the probe.

Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said any attempt by Pompeo to prevent department officials from speaking to them ‚Äúis illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction,‚Äù according to a statement issued by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who heads the foreign affairs panel.

The Democrats‚Äô statement came after Pompeo informed them hours earlier that five State Department officials called to give depositions in the inquiry into President Trump‚Äôs actions regarding Ukraine over the next two weeks would not appear as scheduled this week.""

Myles Erlick and Isaac Lupien from ""The Next Step"" came by for dinner the other night...We decided to create an alternate version of our Hello cover on a surfboard. Hope you enjoy!

Lyrics 
Adele- Hello

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

1290,1290,C3_VFajb9PU,My 101 Pound Journey,Laykyn Owczarzak,22,2012-02-29T11:48:59.000Z,My|Movie|Crossfit|Weightloss|Fit|Health|Gym|Workout|Journey|101|Visalus,9682,34,0,9,"I decided to join the Body By Vi challenge because I am only twenty years old and have struggled with being overweight for most of my life. I have tried every diet under the sun since I was in the seventh grade. The different diets I tried worked for like two weeks and then things always seemed to go haywire. So I always gave up in the end when things got tough. Throughout junior high and high school I struggled with being overweight and I had low self-esteem because of it. But during the summer of 2011 that little light bulb finally went on in my head. I told myself that I could not continue on like this because there are places I want to see and things I want to accomplish and also I did not want to die young. I finally realized that if I wanted this bad enough I had to put in the hard work, effort, and have the determination in order to make it happen. 

 So I officially started with my journey working out at next level fitness on august 1, 2011 at 320 pounds with a goal in mind to lose 170 pounds in one year. I couldn't believe I actually loved working out and was seeing awesome results, but I was looking for something more with the diet/nutrition side of it. So many people that I've worked out with would always talk about Body By Vi and how easy it was. So I decided to try it out for myself and see what would happen. I will admit I was a little hesitant at first because I have tried so many things before.  

 I started my first 90 day challenge with a few other people on September 21, 2011 at 295 pounds. My goal for this challenge was to lose 30 pounds and feel good about myself. It was a little weird at first drinking a shake for breakfast and lunch but then I realized how much easier it was to make a shake then do a quick run at the drive-thru. I was finally feeling good about myself and was amazed at the results I was seeing. I ended my first 90 day challenge on December 19, 2011 at 252 pounds. I could not believe I lost 43 pounds in 90 days and I definitely passed my goal of 30 pounds. 

 I was so happy with the results I received, that I started my second 90 day challenge the next day. I made a new year's resolution to reach the 100lb lost mark by Valentine's Day or else I would do a Crossfit WOD of 100 Burpees & a 1 Mile Run (these are the two things I dislike the most). February 14 came and I made it, I weighed in at 118.8, which translates into 101 pounds since I started my journey august 1, 2011. I am not done yet, I have 69lbs. to go and the determination to make it. Thank you visalus for creating the 90 day challenge and changing so many people's lives.

AADAT Lyrics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tu vaada kita si ki jind
Teri khushiyan naal bhar dau
 
Tu aakhda hunda si ki chann
Tere paira ch vich thar dau
Na tu vaada pura kitta
Na tu chan hi lai aaya
Mere kamle dil nu kyun
Tu aivve dukhan vich paya
Ki das majboori pai gyi aa
 
Dil mera vi karde chadd da par
Teri aadat pai gayi aa
Dil mera vi karda chadd da par
Teri aadat pai gayi aa..(2x)
 
Kaisi ae dooriyan koi hal hi nahi
Aaj vi tu aaya na
Tu aauna kal vi nahi
Chitthiyan vi paiya main
Tu tha padiyan hi nahi
Kadha hai ae milna
Je gallan kariyan hi nahi
Soch-soch din mukh jande
Ve tere laare nahi mukde
Lakh manna laiya main dil nu ve
Mere hanju nahi mukde ve
Hun meri jaan te pai gyi aa
 
Dil mera vi karde chadd da par
Teri aadat pai gayi aa
Dil mera vi karde chadd da par
Teri aadat pai gayi aa..(2x)
 
Chad dila mereya
Je ohda sar hi gaya
Kinne tenu puchna
Je tu mar vi gya
Gall meri chubugi
Zara sun ke ta ja
Aaj meri gal da
Gussa karke ta ja
Dukh tere saare rakh laine
Ve tere haase nai rakhne
Nirmaan tere ditte hoye
Dilase nahi rakhne
Na tere layi zaroori reh gaya
 
Dil mera vi karde chadd da par
Teri aadat pah gayi aa
Dil mera vi karde chadd da par
Teri aadat pah gayi aa..(2x)

Ayon naman kay Aicel, mabuting tao lang daw ang kliyenteng Chinese at hindi lang daw siya ang tinulungan kundi maging ang iba niyang mga katrabaho. Wala din daw kapalit na hinihingi ang kliyente sa kanyang pagtulong.

Ang tunay raw na dahilan ng kanilang paghihiwalay ay dahil sa madalas silang nag-aaway  ni Franklin na labis raw na nakaka-apekto sa mga bata.

Ano naman ang reaksyon ni Franlin dito?

What part of your life will be the hardest? Are teenage years the hardest years of your life or could it be the years afterwards? Is life in middle school hardest than life in high school? What stages of life will be the hardest for you? Maybe college?  

No one can predict for certain what will be the hardest years of your life because no one knows what calamities might befall you. Nonetheless, there are plenty of studies that tell us most people face certain obstacles in life that all tend to happen at certain times. We are sure you‚Äôve heard of the mid-life crisis, or perhaps teenage angst, or those trying times in early adulthood when people need to grow-up, get a job, and take responsibility for themselves. Then there are the vagaries of old age. The specter of debilitating arthritis, incurable diseases, knowing the Grim Reaper is checking Google Maps to find out how to get to your house. Today we‚Äôll look at when most people face the most difficulties, in this episode of the Infographics Show, What will be the hardest years of your life?

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke."""

MOVING ON // LYRICS

A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him
No, he won't let them go
Lays awake tryna' find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly, but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath up I might never breathe again, so just know this:

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I can't believe I let myself break down

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
No, I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

A boy of anguish now, he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road

Study after study shows the trend, generation z is becoming conservative and mostly resembles libertarians or moderate Republicans. This is a dramatic shift from Millennials who are overwhelmingly progressive.

What happens then is that these companies cannot grow or attract new readers because young people do not want far left media. The outcome is obvious, these companies are laying people off and collapsing.

While social justice is something most people agree with, the regressive left is too authoritarian and off putting.

‚ÄúDonald Trump has announced that he is running for re-election in 2020. He has hired staff to run his campaign. He has filed his paperwork and has been raising money all year. That‚Äôs not to mention the fact that Trump‚Äôs personality and presence is the physical embodiment of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs running‚Äù meme. But apparently, it‚Äôs too early to ask Republicans whether they will back Trump‚Äôs bid because they have not thought about it at all, not even one bit.

On Thursday, CNN published an article that asked a number of GOP lawmakers whether or not they would endorse the sitting president of their own political party. The answers are‚Äîhow can I put it‚Äîso 2016.""*

""CNN‚Äôs Victor Blackwell faced off this morning with Women for Trump‚Äôs Amy Kremer over the Trump administration‚Äôs bad week on immigration.

The week was dominated with discussion of the Trump administration‚Äôs family separation policy. President Trump signed an executive order to keep families together, but the border crisis is ongoing.

Kremer said that ‚Äúimmigrants have to follow the laws‚Äù and go to a port of entry if they don‚Äôt want to be separated from their children in the first place.

‚ÄúAs a mother,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that to my child.‚Äù
Blackwell asked her how anyone could blame a parent in this situation. Kremer again said, ‚ÄúFollow the law and you‚Äôre not gonna be separated from your children.‚Äù‚Äù*

Summary:
As a cheering fan in a large stadium I was wondering what the most effective way to make noise was.  For example, does clapping even matter?  Can you hear a clap from down on the field?  So I attended an actual football game to get some baseline loudness measurements and then went back to USC's Coliseum when it was empty and had 3 friends cycle through 11 different cheering styles in 12 different locations. Then I compared and ranked the best ways to cheer to make you a superfan for your next sporting event.

1348,1348,TtIojDWOsgg,"Generations X, Y, and Z: Which One Are You?",BRIGHT SIDE,26,2018-07-31T03:00:00.000Z,know you generation|your generation|millenials|centennials|gen x|gen z|traditionalists|baby-boomers|psychology|traits of different generations|generational gap|how generations are different|psychology types|psychology tricks|how to understand people|how to understand other generations|personality types|bright side|brightside|bright side videos,1230854,21302,1828,6017,"Since you‚Äôre on the Internet right now you‚Äôve probably already noticed that this space is pretty much dominated by a younger crowd. You‚Äôve likely heard them referred to as ‚ÄúMillennials‚Äù. Or is it Gen Z? And how are they different from Generations X and Y? And how can you make heads or tails of which one you belong to, and what defines your generation? 
According sociologist Karl Mannheim, it all comes down to ‚Äúgenerational location,‚Äù meaning that all members of a generation share a similar collective experience.

TIMESTAMPS
The five generations 0:57
The Traditionalist generation 1:49
The Baby Boomers 2:30
The Gen Y 3:24
The Millenials 4:30
The Gen Z 5:31
What Millennials and Centennials have in common 6:35

SUMMARY
-As of now, there are five living generations in the US: the Traditionalists, who were born before 1945. Then there‚Äôs the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. Anyone born between 1965 and 1979 are considered Generation X, while Millennials, or Gen Y, were born between 1980 and 1995. Finally, there‚Äôs Gen Z, or Centennials, who were born from 1996 to the present.
-Most Traditionalists value hard work, commitment, and practicality, and they don‚Äôt like to be wasteful.
-Boomers started out liberal, when they were involved in all the political and social movements, but then grew more conservative as they aged.
-Gen X got to experience the aftermath of all the changes the Boomers made. The use of computers also took off during these years, making Gen X more entrepreneurial than their parents and grandparents.
-Other generations complain that Millennials are selfish, entitled, narcissistic, addicted to their phones, lazy, impatient, impulsive, overly sensitive, weak-willed, and the name-calling goes on and on.
-Gen Z also tends to value collaboration more, in both school and work. They have a very different relationship with digital devices than previous generations.
-Millennials and Centennials share the most similarities and collective experiences out of all the living generations, so there‚Äôs a lot of debate about the exact range for each of them.

When Ed heard that we were helping to organise a special wedding for two of our deserving listeners, Matt and Kya, and that they had chosen one of his songs for their wedding dance he offered to come and surprise them and give them a wedding gift they will never forget. Congratulations to Matt and Kya we hope you both find the happiness you deserve. And Ed Sheeran, well, we just love you!

#KyleandJackGiveBack #EdSheeran

When KIIS 1065‚Äôs Kyle & Jackie O surprised struggling young Sydney couple Kya and Matt Debono by giving them a dream wedding, worth $80,000, the couple thought things couldn‚Äôt get any better.
 
But Kyle & Jackie, who were among the wedding guests today, had one more surprise‚Ä¶
 
Kya and Matt had chosen ‚ÄòThinking Out Loud‚Äô, their favourite song, as the first dance as husband and wife but they never imagined Ed Sheeran himself would stop by the reception to perform it for them. The shock and then joy on the bride‚Äôs face is priceless, and there wasn‚Äôt a dry eye in the crowd as Ed Sheeran gave a genuine and beautifully flawless acoustic performance.
 
A little over a month ago, Kyle and Jackie O received an email from Matt explaining that his dream was to surprise the love of his life, and mother of two, with the wedding she was planning but had to postpone indefinitely.
 
Money had always been tight for the young family from Sydney‚Äôs Revesby, with Matt unemployed, but after the sudden death of Kya‚Äôs mother in 2012, it looked as though their plans for a small wedding with family and friends may never happen.
 
Last week, Kyle and Jackie O had the young couple come to the studio under the guise of participating in a new radio segment but then surprised them on air by gifting them with the wedding of their dreams worth $80,000.
 
Thanks to Kyle & Jackie‚Äôs friends at the Sydney Bridal Expo (April 18 & 19 Moore Park), everything for Matt and Kya‚Äôs wedding would be taken care of, from the bride‚Äôs gown and make up, to the photos, reception venue, entertainment, and even a honeymoon valued at $10,000.
 
And it all came together seamlessly today, with the happy couple married at The Waterfront Function Centre in Sans Souci by none other than celebrant Carol Provan, Sutherland Shire councillor and former Mayor.
 
Known more for the weddings he has missed than attended, this was one event that Kyle wasn‚Äôt going to miss. He and Jackie were honoured to be among the guests at the wedding this afternoon to wish Kya and Matt all the best for their future.

Made possible by Sydney Bridal Expo."

""The man who berated employees and customers for speaking Spanish in a New York City cafe has a history of aggressively confronting strangers on their identity.

Aaron Schlossberg, an attorney in New York, was identified as the man in a Fresh Kitchen in Manhattan who angrily told employees and customers to speak English because ""This is America!""
""If they have the balls to come here and live off my money, I pay for their welfare,"" he says, incorrectly asserting that undocumented immigrants are eligible for federal public benefits. ""I pay for their ability to be here. The least they can do ... is speak English.‚Äù

Lyrics 
Camila Cabello- Havana

Hey...Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that ""how you doin'?"" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na
Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
My heart is in Havana (ay)
Havana, ooh na-na
Jeffery
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
Fresh out East Atlanta
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)
Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me
Get to diggin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that be
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, man they feel me
Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
My heart is in Havana (ay)

LYRICS

Voices in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They‚Äôre pulling me under.

I‚Äôve swallowed myself but the fever remains
I‚Äôm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain       
If I showed you my soul, would you cover your eyes?
If I told you the truth, would you dare me to lie?   

I keep it all inside because I know that man is every thing but kind 

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win  
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death 
I curse not the ‚Äúwicked‚Äù, I praise not the ‚Äúblessed‚Äù
If I told you the truth, you‚Äôd beg me to change
If fear were a currency, you‚Äôd own the bank 

I don‚Äôt want to live so calloused and frozen / ugly and hopeless

Hindi naman ito itinanggi ng kanyang misis at kinompirmang alam na daw ito ng kanyang mister dahil siya na mismo ang nagsabi. Maaga daw silang kinasal at inakala niyang si Jilson na ang lalaking para sa kanya. Ngunit, nagbago daw ito nung sila ay kinasal at hindi raw siya trinatong parang misis kaya nagkarelasyon siyang muli sa kanyang ex. Wala na daw sila ngayon ng ex niya pero ayaw na din daw niyang makipagbalikan pa kay Jilson.

Nag-alok si Idol na sila ay muling magka-ayos at mag-i-sponsor pa ng kanilang second honeymoon. Papayag ba ang mag-asawa?

PAALALA: Huwag maniniwala sa ano mang text o tawag na nagpapakilalalang staff ng Raffy Tulfo in Action. Ang lahat ng reklamo ay aming hinaharap sa TV5 Media Center lamang (Reliance corner Sheridan Street, Mandaluyong City. Monday-Friday, 9am to 3pm). Ang aming pagtulong ay libre. 

Huwag po kayong magpost ng inyong comments na gusto ninyong makatulong o nagtatanong kung paano kayo makakatulong sa mga complainant na nasa video. Marami na po kaming natatanggap na reklamo tungkol sa mga taong nagbibigay ng maling impormasyon o nagpapanggap na staff ng Raffy Tulfo in Action para makapanloko. Kung nais po ninyong tumulong sa mga taong nasa video, magsadya lamang po kayo o magpadala ng representative sa TV5 Media Center at para personal na iabot sa mismong mga taong gusto ninyong matulungan. Salamat po.

Lyrics 
The Weeknd- Can't Feel My Face

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face (I can't feel nothing) when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, (but I love it) oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, (but I love it) oh
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it (oh I love it) oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (said I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (face, when I'm with you)
But I love it (but I love it) but I love it, don't you think I can't
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (when I'm with you baby) but I love it, (when I'm with you baby)

Lyrics 
FUN! - Some Nights

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
And that's alright, I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I?

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh

A gemstone (also called a gem, fine gem, jewel, precious stone, or semi-precious stone) is a piece of mineral crystal which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. However, certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli, opal, and jade) or organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.
Finding the rare gemstones aren't easy. But if you happen to find any of these rare gemstones, they can land you a hefty amount of money. These valuable rare stones / stone / gemstone / gemstones are including Taaffeite, Demantoid, black opal. colored diamond / diamonds (blue diamond, yellow diamond, pink diamond, red diamond), Benitoite, Padparadscha, Red beryl, Alexandrite, Jadeite and Musgravite.

""The steel and aluminum industries in China will soon be slapped with tariffs up to $50 billion by President Donald Trump. On Thursday, after China announced their intentions to retaliate against the United States with $50 billion in tariffs of their own against U.S. goods, Trump warned that his administration would respond with another set of tariffs, this time targeting $100 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Exempt from the proposed tariffs against China, however, is the clothing manufacturing industry.
U.S. officials say they used an algorithm to determine which goods to exclude from new tariffs. According to the Washington Post, the list was drafted to achieve ‚Äúthe lowest consumer impact,‚Äù ensuring goods like clothing and toys were excluded so as not to raise the cost on domestic consumer goods.‚Äù*

Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

Read more here: https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-interview-mueller

""President Donald Trump has said he‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking forward‚Äù to the prospect of sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But according to a New York Times report Monday, his private legal team is vehemently urging him to decline any invitation to talk to Mueller.

Negotiations are continuing. But constitutional law experts told TPM that if the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown‚Äîone in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.

A decision by the White House to reject Mueller‚Äôs request for a voluntary interview would signal a clear shift in the Trump legal team‚Äôs game plan from cooperation to delay.

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre sort of pushing Mueller into a corner where he has to file a subpoena and Trump refuses to comply with the subpoena, they‚Äôre switching tracks to a whole new strategy of delay,‚Äù said Jens Ohlin, an executive privilege expert at Cornell Law School. ‚ÄúThey just want to prevent Mueller from completing his investigation. Which on the one hand is bad for Trump because it keeps the Russia investigation hanging over his head in perpetuity. But, on the other hand, it keeps Trump away from Mueller, and keeps him out of any kind of danger.‚Äù‚Äù*

Lyrics 
One Direction- Drag Me Down

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason
If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
I got a fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left (nothing left)
The shell of a man who could never be his best (be his best)
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun (see the sun)
You taught me how to be someone
Yeah
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Summary:  I collected data at the carnival for a full day.  Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.

Follow my marine biologist friend Luke Tipple on Instagram- https://www.instagram.com/luketipple/

More info that was promised-
What is likely happening is that the sharks can smell the blood but it's just not in a quantity that is interesting to them especially since they don't love human blood that much (btw, I spoke with a marine biologist and mammal blood is all the same from a chemical marker stand point so cow blood is a suitable substitute for human blood).  If I did the experiment again, I would want to test human blood vs. fish blood.  

This is the most definitive study done to date in a control lab environment on what is least and most interesting to them:  The Biology of Sharks and Rays Peter A. Klimley and Steven Oerding;  ISBN-13: 9780226442495. Particularly pages 134-140. Figure 6.7; Table 6.2

Summary:  I've always wanted to test if sharks can really smell a single drop of blood in the water from 1 mile away.  So I went to the Bahamas in shark infested waters and set up an experiment to get to the bottom of things.

[LYRICS]
We were born from light before there even was a dawn,
So pure, so bright
Caught in destiny we shine for we are meant to be
The Star Guardians

Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong,
Don‚Äôt fade away it‚Äôs time to shine

Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter 
Runnin outta time, we‚Äôre chasing the light

Gone in a flash before our time 
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong,
Don‚Äôt fade away it‚Äôs time to shine

Burning bright 
As we reach out for the same horizon 
Burning brighter
Piercing through the dawn, we burn on and on (and on)"

""Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman on Monday released a second recording from her time at the White House, purportedly of President Donald Trump appearing unaware that chief of staff John Kelly had fired her.

‚ÄúNobody even told me about it,‚Äù Trump says in the recording of a phone call that Newman says is from the day after she was fired from her White House communications post in December. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it. I didn‚Äôt know that. Goddammit. I don‚Äôt love you leaving at all.‚Äù

The short audio aired ahead of a ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show interview with Newman on Monday, part of a publicity tour for Tuesday‚Äôs release of her book about her time at the White House, Unhinged.

Newman, in a combative interview on ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù dodged questions about whether Trump was lying on the phone call, saying that she was ‚Äúnot certain.‚Äù She added that Trump, in general, is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù a serial liar, but said she ‚Äúnever expected him to lie to the country.‚Äù

She said she was locked in a room before Kelly told her she was fired, and characterized the meeting as ‚Äúfalse imprisonment.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not acceptable for four men to take a woman into a room, lock the door and tell her ‚Äòwait,‚Äô and tell her that she cannot leave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt also is unacceptable to not allow her to have her lawyer or her counsel, and the moment I said ‚ÄòI would like to leave‚Äô and they said I can‚Äôt go, it became false imprisonment.‚Äù

‚ÄúPresident Trump on Wednesday stood by his decision to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection.

Trump noted that President Obama also called to congratulate Putin after his 2012 election victory and said it is a ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù for the U.S. to have warm relations with Russia.

‚Ä¶

Trump called Putin on Tuesday and congratulated him on winning a fourth term. The leaders also discussed a potential face-to-face meeting in the future.

The president has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the call. Election observers and Putin's political opponents have issued charges of widespread fraud in the election.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called Trump's congratulations an insult to the Russian people and said that ‚Äúan American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.‚Äù‚Äù*

LYRICS

Will you hold the line, when every one of them has given up and given in, tell me 
In this house of mine 
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost tell me 
Will the stars align
Will heaven step in will it save us from our sin, will it? 
‚ÄòCause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay 
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up 
‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre a natural 
A beating heart of stone 
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural 
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural

Will somebody, let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing 
What‚Äôs happenin?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
We are youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it. 
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay 
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up 
‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre a natural 
A beating heart of stone 
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural 
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural

Deep inside me
I‚Äôm fading to black I‚Äôm fading 
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won‚Äôt break it 
I can taste it the end is upon us I swear
gonna make it 
I‚Äôm gonna make it 

Natural
A beating heart of stone 
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural 
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold 
Yeah you‚Äôre a natural

Generation Z is not at fault for their failures. Nate Turner explains accountability from all other generations.  Nathaniel A. Turner was born and raised in Gary, Indiana.  Despite graduating in the bottom quarter of his high school class from one of the worst and most impoverished school systems in the country, Nate went on to earn several degrees.  Nate holds a Bachelors (Accounting), a Masters (Theology & History), and a Juris Doctorate degree.
Nate is an entrepreneur and has operated a financial services practice for two decades.  Not withstanding his professional accomplishments, Nate's greatest passion is helping children realize what he rarely experienced growing up in Gary: feeling valued as a human being and knowing his life had a purpose.Today, Nate's counsel and advice are included on his blog ""The Raising Supaman Project"", his radio show ""The Road Less Traveled"", and in his books ""Raising Supaman"" and ""Stop The Bus"".  Nate encourages parents, guardians, and the community to raise children to become great world citizens and he challenges us all to maximize our abilities to their fullest potential.  Nate also speaks nationally and contributes to other nationally recognized blogs, publications, and radio programs.Nate believes each day is another opportunity to share valuable experiences, tools, methods, and resources with those charged with preparing the sons and daughters of our Nation.  Nate considers it a calling to make certain that OUR future is ready for this awesome journey called life. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"

Hear the story of lies, deception and foul play.

Dr. Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people.

The Dr. Phil show provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television. For over a decade, Dr. McGraw has used the show's platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the ""silent epidemics"" of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide and various forms of severe mental illness."

1001 Nights : The story is about ≈ûehrazat Evliyaoƒülu, a talented architect who works in Binyapƒ±, a construction company owned by Onur Aksal and Kerem ƒ∞nceoƒülu. She is the mother of a five-year old boy who suffers from leukemia and needs an urgent and very expensive surgery. Onur Aksal is a successful businessman and ≈ûehrazat desperately tries to find ways to borrow the money she needs for her son's very costly surgery, a bone marrow transplantation, because her little son's life is in danger. Only her boss Onur, who is secretly attracted to her, accepts to give her the money on condition that she spends one night with him. After that night, Onur cannot stop thinking about her. He arranges their business trip to Dubai in order to be alone with her. At the hotel elevator in Dubai he repeats the same indecent offer, a night with him, and he doubles the amount of money. ≈ûehrazat refuses his offer, deeply disgusted and furious. She realizes that Onur will not stop thinking about what happened between them and decides to try to find another job away from him. At the same time, Onur is very upset at what he did in Dubai, to ask ≈ûehrazat to accept his indecent proposal. He gets very regretful and tries to show her how deeply he cares for her. Onur feels very bad about himself and for what he has made her endure professionally and personally and becomes increasingly attached to her. Convinced that he cannot live without her, Onur asks ≈ûehrazat to marry him and begs her to give him a chance to make her love him. She finally accepts his marriage proposal. However things become complicated when Onur's mother refuses to approve of their marriage. But finally, Onur's mother understands that her son feels a profound and sincere love for ≈ûehrazat and eventually accepts her daughter-in-law. Many events occur in the third season, as well. Kerem reveals Onur's and ≈ûehrazat's secret (the one night stand for money compensation) which leads to their divorce. They will get together by the end of the third season and live happily ever after."

Fifth Avenue Lyrics:

You see when I was 18 I was lazy as sin
Smoking a Blunt no matter mood I was in 
It's a coming of age thing, born with a rage thing 
I knew I had to leave home. 

So I packed my big blue bag and I took off to New York, I got a one bedroom with a flag on the porch, I said, I‚Äôll see ya later, all ya alligators. Haha

It's like the forth of July when I'm living my life hanging with the mets and the Yankees every night, making my Dreams come true on Fifth Avenue. No more wasting my time or waiting for a sign, I got a bugoti and a lambo on my mind. Dreams come true on Fifth Avenue. 

This is the land of the great where you can shoot for the stars. 
All That i need is a break so I can play my guitar 
But the cities a jungle it's keeping me humble, man I'm so far from home. 
 
But I keep my train on the tracks cause I still want me some more, not just my name in lights I want the whole billboard. You'll see me in a while all ya crocodiles. Haha

Which one has more style and which one is more independent? 

Separated by the Atlantic Ocean, American women aren‚Äôt much different from their European cousins. But it‚Äôs almost impossible to compare women from all across Europe as the continent covers a real range of nationalities, cultures, and ethnicity. So be warned that this show may make some broad generalizations which we hope you‚Äôll excuse. What we‚Äôre attempting to do today is compare European and American women. What makes them tick? How do they behave? And what are the similarities and differences between them? That‚Äôs what we will try to find out in today‚Äôs Infographics Show as we look at‚Äì American Girls Vs European Girls.

‚ÄúThe Pentagon is rolling out military hardware for a Fourth of July unlike any other. Tanks on the National Mall and military flyovers will be part of the capital's celebration, by order of President Trump. He'll be the first president to take an active role in any July Fourth ceremony in recent memory.

These flyovers cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, though military officials say they are essentially training flights and therefore not an extra cost to taxpayers. But the National Park Service is reportedly diverting nearly $2.5 million, originally intended for parks across the country, for the celebration.

""Certainly going to be more expensive than previous years. Anytime you get a presidential visit there are inherent security costs,"" said Mark Litterst of the National Park Service.

The National Park Service said on Tuesday it was still waiting for the run of show from the White House ‚Äì proof this is a show, one stage-managed by the president down to the placement of tanks and infantry vehicles and the sequence of military flyovers, reports CBS News' Major Garrett. The Fourth of July is typically nonpartisan and a tribute to America's founding documents and self-government. 
 
The event is being called is called a ""Salute to America"" but Mr. Trump has made it clear that  the military will be front and center. ""We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display ‚Äì brand new. And we're very proud of it,"" Mr. Trump said.‚Äù

""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to escalate a trade war with Europe by imposing a 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports of European Union-assembled cars.

Trump posted his threat on Twitter the day European Union reprisals took effect against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The EU targeted $3.2 billion in American goods exported to the 28-member bloc.

‚ÄúIf these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!‚Äù Trump wrote.

A month ago, the administration launched a probe into whether auto imports pose a national security threat.‚Äù*

Lyrics 
Madonna- Material Girl

Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day
'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see

Lyrics 
Pharrell Williams- Happy

It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news, talking this and that
(Yeah) Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back 
(Yeah) Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine 
(Yeah) No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Hey, come on, uh
Bring me down, can't nuthin' (happy)
Bring me down
My level is too high to bring me down (happy)
Can't nuthin', bring me down (happy)
I said, let me tell you now, unh (happy)
Bring me down, can't nuthin', bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
My level is too high to bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
Can't nuthin' bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Come on, unh bring me down can't nuthin' (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down my level is too high (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down can't nuthin' (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

Another large deal was the $115-million purchase of the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles Downtown.

Tim Kaine on Sunday said President Donald Trump continuing to blame Democrats for the lack of permanent protections for young undocumented immigrants is a break with reality.
""He is either lying or he is completely delusional,"" Kaine said. Trump said Democrats were responsible for there being no permanent fix on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, claiming, ""The Democrats fought us, they just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.""
Kaine noted that then-President Barack Obama established the program, and that it is Trump who moved to end it.
""One person can save DACA,"" Kaine said. ""If President Trump believes in DACA, all he has to do is retract his executive order from September where he broke a promise to Dreamers and said he was going to end the program."""

Project Inspired By:

Mikey77's Instructable on Ooogoo: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Your-Own-Sugru-Substitute/

Project History & More Info:

Casting silicone is very expensive, so over the years I tried to find a cheaper alternative to making LEGO candy molds (https://goo.gl/XcLbep).  

I started off trying silicone caulk from the hardware store, but globs of it would take weeks and weeks to finally firm up.  That wasn't acceptable because I needed something that would harden in 24 hours or less.

About 3 years ago I came across an Instructable by Mikey77 showing that mixing corn starch into the silicone caulk could be used to make it firm up in under an hour.

I did a number of experiments of my own, and eventually found out that corn starch wasn't actually needed at all, but that all you needed was to add a little food coloring.

I still like to use corn starch though because it helps prevent the caulk from sticking to my hands as I work with it.  The stuff is really hard to get off if it sticks to skin!"

Lyrics 
Omi- Cheerleader

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she' stay strong yeah yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating.
And I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating.
And I'm like no, not really cause'
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need the next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

These are short actors and surprisingly short celebrities and the world‚Äôs shortest actors!


8. Michael J. Fox - This Canadian-born actor has been on the scene since 1973. However, the role that truly jump-started his career was his portrayal of Marty McFly in the 1985 film, Back to the Future. He‚Äôs known for other work as well including a couple of television shows, like Spin City from 1996 to 2001 and The Good Wife from 2010 to 2016. It‚Äôs safe to say Michael J. Fox has made a big impact even if he doesn‚Äôt measure up to most men physically. This award-winning star is just under 5‚Äô5‚Äù, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped him from taking home four Golden Globes and five Primetime Emmys throughout his career so far. Although Fox can‚Äôt travel back in time in real life, there‚Äôs no need since he‚Äôll continue to accomplish great things in the future. 

7. Kevin Hart - Although this comedian began his career on stage doing stand-up, he has prospered in the field of acting, while continuing his live performances. Kevin Hart had a rough introduction to the entertainment industry, similar to most people who are just starting out. He was reportedly unpopular during his first appearance at The Laff House in his hometown. After continuing his efforts in spite of initial defeat, Hart was cast in television movies and series, like North Hollywood in 2001 and Undeclared from 2002 to 2003. He went on to take roles in bigger-name films like Ride Along in 2014 to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle just last year. He‚Äôs known for all of these achievements, but people also recognize him as being somewhat shorter than most. Hart stands at 5‚Äô4‚Äù, and has even included his compactness in some of his stand-up routines over the years. This actor may have trouble reaching the top of the fridge, but he has no problem attaining new heights in his career. 

6. Seth Green - A huge deal in the world of comedy, this actor is ahead of the curve when it comes to making people laugh. Seth Green has played in movies like Without a Paddle in 2004 and Dear Dictator just recently. He‚Äôs also well-known for his ongoing work in television series including Robot Chicken and Family Guy, and has taken home several awards for the former. Although he‚Äôs reached new heights through his career, Green only stands at 5‚Äô4‚Äù. But, what this actor doesn‚Äôt have regarding tallness, he makes up for in comedic genius"

""President Donald Trump signaled his support for Scott Pruitt on Friday, resisting mounting pressure week to fire the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency.

In a tweet, he blamed the reporters who this week broke a series of stories detailing Pruitt‚Äôs living arrangements, spending and management of the agency, intensifying accusations of corruption and government waste. Pruitt, he said, was ‚Äúunder siege.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump

Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!

For Tour dates and more go to: http://www.MarkTremonti.com

Mark Tremonti is the Grammy Award-winning guitarist and songwriter known for his work in the critically acclaimed Alter Bridge and in the multi-platinum rock juggernaut Creed. His sound is recognizable and has garnered him a loyal fan base worldwide. 

In 2012, Mark formed Tremonti with Eric Friedman and Garrett Whitlock as an outlet for his love of harder riffs and the band has released three full-length albums to date. On June 8th, Tremonti returns with their fourth album A Dying Machine, a concept album that showcases Mark‚Äôs unique songwriting style and vocal melodies. Anthemic choruses, punishing riffs and fiery guitar solos are displayed on the album in rockers like ‚ÄòFrom the sky‚Äô and ‚ÄòThrow them to the lions‚Äô and places them alongside the infectiously catchy ‚ÄòTake you with me‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe first the last‚Äô.

Tremonti will be on a worldwide tour in support of A Dying Machine including opening for Iron Maiden this summer."

About GGMF:

Ten years ago, a great civil war stretched across the galaxy. A brilliant scientist created blueprints for a superweapon that could end the war: The exosuit. That man was the founder of Fortune Industries. When his comrades discovered the exosuit plans, they wasted no time murdering him. He was survived by his only daughter, who they shot and left for dead.
 
Over the years, she acquired four exosuits, became the notorious bounty hunter known as the Gun Goddess, and swore vengeance on these traitors. Now she‚Äôs ready to collect the debt she‚Äôs owed."

Additionally, Payton weighs in on why he disagrees with Shaquille O'Neal's remarks about LeBron's legacy and why he believes Michael Jordan had a better supporting cast than people like to remember when discussing who the true G.O.A.T. is.

""A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The decision to award contracts to Windham Professionals and Performant Financial Corp. ‚Äî a company DeVos invested in before becoming secretary ‚Äî arrives a month after a federal judge ordered the department to complete its selection of a loan collector to put an end to a messy court battle. Windham and Performant beat out nearly 40 other bidders for contracts valued at up to $400 million, but their win may be short-lived if the losing companies fight the decision.""

https://www.newsweek.com/betsy-devos-cayman-islands-taxes-yacht-flag-foreign-donald-trump-america-1061960

""When someone untied a yacht owned by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos‚Äôs family, the episode was portrayed as an example of anti-Trump harassment. But the yacht‚Äôs foreign flag illustrated how an allegedly ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù administration is full of moguls who have stashed their wealth offshore in ways that help them avoid taxes, regulations, transparency requirements and domestic employment laws.

We already know that Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao‚Äôs family shipping consortium routes its business through the Marshall Islands‚Äîa notoriously secretive tax haven. Federal records detail how Trump‚Äôs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton and Federal Reserve board appointee Randal Quarles held parts of their personal fortunes in investments based in the Cayman Islands, which are not necessarily required to adhere to America‚Äôs domestic financial regulations.""

""Diljale is a story about love and patriotism. Captain Ranvir is assigned the task of apprehending two terrorists named Shaka and Dara. Upon arrival in the region, he falls in love with Radhika, the daughter of Rajasaheb, who also is a Minister. The latter approves of him, and arranges his wedding with his daughter. Before the engagement could take place, Ranvir finds out that he has a rival in Shaka, who was in love with Radhika before, and is all set to prevent this marriage at any and costs. Ranvir decides to postpone his wedding until such time he arrests Shaka and his associates - a decision that will not only pit him against well-armed terrorists, but also result in the abduction of a bus-load of Vaishnodevi devotees - which include Radhika and her Bua. Watch the film to know the backstory of Shaka and Radhika.

Summary:  I visited Lindsay Blackstock at the University of Alberta to learn about her ingenious method for measuring the amount of pee in a pool by looking at the concentration of an artificial sweetener called Acefulfame Potassium.  We looked at some samples from some pools in my area to determine how much pee was in them and I conducted an experiment of my own to see what was the cause of that ""classic pool smell"".  I also presented average amounts of pee in large pools as well as an equation to determine how much pee is in your own pool.

""Fox News' Fox & Friends show on Sunday showed a preview of an interview in which soon-to-depart Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said Donald Trump was God's ""chosen one"" to be president of the United States.

In the interview conducted as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry, Perry implied that Trump is imperfect and that is fine.

""God's used imperfect people all through history,"" Perry said, naming several Biblical figures. ""King David wasn't perfect, Saul wasn't perfect, Solomon wasn't perfect.""
