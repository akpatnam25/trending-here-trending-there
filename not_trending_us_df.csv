Subscribe: http://goo.gl/Q2kKrD

Voice acting is a skill that's pretty tough because you have to give a great performance using only your vocals. These big name celebs, like Johnny Depp and Jack Black, were up to the challenge. WatchMojo takes a look at the actors behind the voices of some of your favorite animated characters. 

List entries and rank:
#10: Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best/Frozone
#9: Johnny Depp as Rango
#8: John C. Reilly as Wreck-It Ralph
#7: Jay Baruchel as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III
#6: John Goodman as James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan
#5: Chris Pratt as Emmet Brickowski
#4: Jack Black as Po Ping
#3, #2 & #1: ?

For this list, we’re taking a look at more big name actors that loaned their voices to big screen characters rendered through animation, motion capture, or practical effects.

I saw you walk
You know you say
Like a ghost you know to me babe
Combat boots make you look silly
Oh now I see you walking home from school
You got so lost on your way
You got me feeling like a kid 
But this man is no kid you know
So I'm not gonna pull your hair

I fall so hard inside the idea of you 
That's why with you can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think I'm gettin outta here
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

Aw there you go again
I know you're shy 
And I see you walk past with your friends
And I saw you laugh and whisper
And I'll talk, I want you here
But you turn back and smile at me
Aw you got me feeling okay with that
So I'm not gonna pull your hair

I fall so hard inside the idea of you 
That's why with you can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think, ""God get me outta here,""
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

Bus stop dreamer 
The late night
You with me
There's something moving
You can't stop, saying that you love me
You love me, you love me
Enough, enough you make me shy
But baby, I wake up
Aw, aw, yeah

I saw you

I fall so hard inside the idea of you 
That's why with you I can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think I'm gettin outta here
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

Oh it's so, go on baby say it

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

We're laughin"

Find out as Mayer goes toe to toe with the wings of death, tackling anything and everything along the way: Justin Bieber's melody wizardry, the best guitar faces in history, his obsession with Visvim, living in Montana, the musicality of Dave Chappelle's comedy, and so much more. And, because this is the grand finale of season 5, there's a very special surprise at the end of the episode to send all you spicelords off into the sunset. Stay tuned for more on Season 6, as well as some other exciting Hot Ones announcements coming soon.

Disclaimer
I can’t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try."

LYRICS: 
I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day, yeah
'Cause all I do is cry behind this smile
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I-I-It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

also the video's kinda long (i tried to make it as short as possible) so I added a bunch of dumb edits that i hope keep you entertained lol

Thanks to Tony, James, Alex, Den, Dom, Jomm, Leigh, Rebecca, Cade, Soy, Tiffany, Red, all my friends, and everyone else I finally was able to meet~ You all made this trip the best experience I could've ever asked for. And I'm still in shock about how many people we met and ran into this trip! I wasn't expecting anyone to want to see us, but signing for more than 2 hours all together and running into so many followers just walking around really put things into perspective.. I'm so happy that people are enjoying the videos we make, and it makes me happy to know people really care about us :) Thank you

For 50 years we've been trapped in two dimensions, with flat input devices like the mouse, track pad and touchscreen as our only windows into the digital world. John is passionate about how using neuroscience can inform building a truly natural operating environment for navigating the future of computing, one in which AR becomes a healthy, vital extension of who we are and creates deeper understanding, freer expression and optimal productivity.

Augmented reality will change the way we think about design, health, medicine. Imagine a neurosurgeon being able to superimpose a brain scan onto a patient’s head from different views before cutting into the patient’s head to remove a tumor.

Augmented reality superimposes digital information or images onto the physical world to enhance the way we view our surroundings (think Pokémon Go).




John Werner is an innovator, mobilizer, and human super connector. He constantly builds community and is a ""moonshot"" thinker, innovating as he goes while incorporating the latest technologies. He believes passionately in 21st century collaborative creativity in innovating with direct human or environmental impact.  John is the vice president of Strategic Partnerships at Metavision where he explores augmented reality. He is the recipient of the Loeb Fellowship at Harvard Graduate Study of Design. Additionally, he is the founder of TEDxBeaconStreet and on the board of advisors for TEDx along with a number of other TED affiliations. His work has been featured in dozens of TED talks.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"

There are great arguments for a cocktail garnish: aroma & sexiness. A cocktail with a nice garnish can be more alluring. And, the key to a great cocktail experience is the aroma.

Home Bartender Starter Kit: http://bit.ly/2DTOJcN
Learn more at http://learn.awesomedrinks.com

The most common citrus garnish is the classic citrus twist. While it may take some practice to get looking fantastic, this is still fits into the easy cocktail garnishes mantra. The best citrus twists come off fresh citrus fruit. Older fruit with a drier peel becomes difficult to work with and loses a lot of the appeal that makes twists fun.

Playing with citrus zest can be a rewarding experience. Especially when you get to flame them and make fire! A citrus zest is most often a slice of citrus off your fruit, cut with a sharp knife (leaving little pith on the skin/zest) or a potato peeler.

A fruit flag is a garnish which wraps a cocktail cherry in a slide of citrus, usually an orange slice. Using a garnish pick, stick the sharp end through the left side of an orange slice, then add a Luxardo Maraschino Cherry on the stick. Lastly, poke your sharp pick end through the right side of the orange slice.

Spring and summer time are your chances to excel at herbal garnishes! Garnishing with herbs is simple easy. For a refreshing mojito or tiki drink you'll find a sprig of mint makes a perfect garnish.

The salt rim technique is well established in the margarita market. No doubt you've ordered a margarita at a bar, pub or restaurant and encountered a salt rim. Many establishments will use a margarita salt, which is often a blend of salts and spices. A margarita salt is typically larger / course salt that really pops off the rim and looks impressive.

By far the easiest garnish is the whole garnish, those that you just spear and top.  An olive in a martini on a bamboo garnish pick is a great example. Or, onions in a gibson martini which gives the drinker both a savory onion aroma alongside a treat when the drink is finished.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

[Bridge]
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?


[Pre Chorus: Alessia Cara + Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

[Bridge: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

[Outro: Alessia Cara]
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

We searched the ""as is"" (floor model/ damaged items) section for an item that we could transform into awesome student/ dorm room decor.

We completed a makeover on this (slightly boring) grey chair and table combo to make a desk with some storage that any dorm room would love!

Today, he operates one of the best pizzerias not only in New York City, but the entire world. In a rare, intimate glimpse at Iacono's life, this Food Skills mini-doc charts the chef's unlikely rise from Brooklyn construction worker to internationally renowned pizzaiolo. While walking the streets of his native Carroll Gardens, Iacono reminisces about a rapidly changing neighborhood, and unlocks the keys to his world-famous margherita pie. From studying at the altar of Di Fara’s Dom DeMarco, to serving A-list celebrities like Jay Z and Beyoncé, the story of Lucali is made of pizza lore and legend.

Inspired by a recent (and epic) conversation I had with a friend who had to face an ex soon after the break up. This quite rambly (sorry!) tutorial covers make-up tips for any stressful situations where you have been upset/stressed/crying etc. I was going to cut it right down to 10mins but after asking everyone on facebook if I should leave it long and chatty.... hundreds said yes leave it! So here it is more or less in its entirety - there's even a guest appearance from one of my cats! Hope its helpful and useful to all of you going through something like this.

Lyrics:

If these walls came crumblin' down
Fell so hard, to make us lose our faith
From what's left you'd figure it out
Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

Stay, beautiful baby
I hope you
Stay, American baby
American baby

Nobody's laughing now
God's grace lost and the devil is proud
But I've been walking for a thousand miles
One last time, I could see you smile"

This video teaches my preferred versions of the six cocktails whose creation inspired the entire universe of cocktails we have today. Every serious bartender who has been studying cocktails for a while are familiar with the idea that there are Root cocktails, or cocktails which are not only a specific drink but gave birth to a category by lending their template to countless other drinks. I will often see someone in the comments saying something like this: ""Oh this drinks is just a so and so cocktail with the sugar and spirit changed out."" While this statement is totally true, it's also true that every cocktail in existence came out of one of the six in this video. The bartenders behind Death & Co. and Proprietor's LLC have recently Published a book called Cocktail Codex all about Root cocktails and everyone should give it a gander, it is a great book!

He talks about his career, the inspiration behind his work, and his thoughts on modern superhero movies. He also discuss adaptations of his own work and teases future projects, including a Western Sin City prequel. If you like comics and celebrity interviews, this is your show. Each week we’re joined by a new guest who hits up a local comic book shop with host Jon Schnepp and peruses the wares while also discussing their career, upcoming projects, and of course their favorite comic books.
 
In this week’s episode, Miller joins Schnepp at Meltdown Comics. He talks about how he first came to love comic books, the inspiration behind Ronin, how The Dark Knight Returns came about and what his original idea for the story was, as well as the impact of that comic on the industry and comics fans. Miller also talks about forging his own original characters with Sin City and his collaboration with Robert Rodriguez on the movies, as well as other adaptations of his work that he’s not involved with like Netflix’s Daredevil and the inclusion of Elektra.
 
Miller also teases future projects, saying he has more historical work along the lines of 300 coming up, and give his thoughts on the current superhero movies, singling out Wonder Woman and Spider-Man: Homecoming as some of his recent favorites. Miller and Schnepp also, of course, go perusing the aisles of the store and pick up some comics.

The Bravo vet also tackles some Top Chef quickfire and teaches Sean how to properly judge a dangerously hot chicken wing.

Person Swap Drive thru The Best Ever Drive thru public prank we made, Pretty much we would order something, then make an excuse for them to go back again so we have a chance to swap sets, once they return back they are really confused what happened. Some of them thought they were going crazy, some having a rough day at work, some pretended they haven't noticed anything etc. Overall these reactions were awesome and priceless, Make sure to Subscribe.

LYRICS:
CHAPTER 54, PAGE ONE-HUNDRED AND
FIVE: CREATE A HELLHOUND ANTIDOTE
AND KEEP YOUR VICTIM ALIVE!

IT SAYS TO COVER ONE EYE BALL...
AND THE OTHER ONE, TOO.
""WHAT FOR?""
THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK SAYS TO DO!

WE’LL NEED A PILE OF RAISINS AND A
MAGICAL WORD. I LIKE TO USE THE
TERM, ""LINGUINE,"" CAUSE IT’S PRETTY
ABSURD!
AND ONCE WE’VE FOUND OURSELVES SOME
RAISINS, POUR THEM INTO A
SHOE! THEN FLICK YOUR EAR! THAT’S
WHAT THE BOOK SAYS TO DO!

WE HAVE TO IRON A CACTUS! STICK A
BEE IN YOUR NOSE! AND THEN WE’LL
EAT A PLATE OF FLAPJACKS! DRAW SOME
FACES ON TOES!
WE’LL ALL HOLD HANDS UNTIL THEY’RE
SWEATY! WE’LL PRETEND WE CAN
FLY! AND IF WE DON’T... WE’LL DIE!

I MADE THAT PART UP...

NOW YOU TAKE A CREEPY BABY DOLL AND
SHAKE IT ALL AROUND! THEN YOU
SHRIEK LIKE A WEASEL WHILE YOU
FLAIL ON THE GROUND!
AND ONCE WE’VE DONE THAT FOR TWO
HOURS, THROW THAT BABY DOWN THE
STAIRS, THEN WE’LL HIT EACH OTHER
WITH METAL CHAIRS!

""I’M HAVING SECOND GUESSES ’BOUT
THIS SPELL-CASTING STUFF...""

""OKAY, I FOUND A COUPLE TUTUS-""

""THAT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH!""

NEXT WE’LL SCATTER SOMEONE’S ASHES
AS WE THROW A PARADE! AND THEN
WE’LL SIT AND HAVE A SEANCE WHILE
WE’RE PLAYING OLD MAID!

WEAR A BIG HAT! DRINK FROM THIS
JAR!

""NONE OF THIS SONG MAKES SENSE SO FAR!""

""I DON’T KNOW WHAT HE’S UP TO, BUT
IT’S CERTAINLY WEIRD-""

""HE KEEPS ASKING FOR TOENAILS-""

""AND A LEPRECHAUN BEARD!""

""I DON’T THINK WE SHOULD TRUST
HIM. HE’S COMPLETELY INSANE-""

""AND ALL THE NONSENSE WE’RE DOING
SEEMS EXPRESSLY INANE.""

""WE SHOULD TOTALLY KILL HIM!""

""YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT.""

""I MEAN, HE LOOKS PRETTY PUNY-""

""WON'T BE MUCH OF A FIGHT!""

""WE CAN SNEAK UP BEHIND HIM!""

""DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH HIS HEART!""

""DO YOUR WORST!""

""LADIES FIRST!""

""IF YOU WON’T IMPALE HIM, THEN ENIS
WILL START A NEW VERSE!""

WE GOTTA WHITTLE A PICKLE! EAT
SOME PARMESAN CHEESE! AND THEN
WE’LL ALL WATCH A MOVIE-

""OH NO, NOT THE BEES!""

AND NEXT, WE TAKE OUT THE
GARBAGE! SUMMON HELLBEASTS FROM
SPACE! AND THEN, WHEN THE PORTAL
CLOSES, PULL HIS SLEEVE UP TO
EXPOSE HIS WOUNDED ARM... AND...
KISS... YOUR... FRIEND’S DEAD FACE!

LET’S EXPEL OUR SPACE-BOUND
HELLBEASTS, THEN WE’LL TAKE OUT THE
TRASH! WE’LL WATCH A FLICK AND EAT
SOME CHEESE AND CUT A PICKLE AND
DASH-

-INSIDE TO PLAY KAZOO AND WEAR A
HAT! USE METAL CHAIRS LIKE BASEBALL
BATS! AND FLAIL AND FLY AND PAINT
ALL YOUR TOES!

WE’LL EAT SOME FLAPJACKS AND STICK
BEES IN YOUR NOSE!

TO GRAB A SHOE TO FILL WITH SNACKS
AND FLICK YOUR EAR WITH SNEAK
ATTACKS AND SCREAM LINGUINE TO THE
MAX SO HERE IT GOES!"

We're back at it again with another Ikea upcyle! Last time you guys requested a vanity/ desk/ makeup mirror so we created one with items from the Ikea as is section! This turned out so minimal yet elegant and was super affordable to make! Let us know in the comments what item / category you'd like us to try and hack next!

Possibly our most anticipated episode next to the massive character juggernaut that undoubtedly will be Infinity War.  Before Justice League was in theaters we had geared ourselves up to experience the final chapter in the Controversial Dark Snyder DC Trilogy, full of themes about responsibility, temptations of power, gods vs humans type stuff.  It was going to be this awesome bow on the end of the Justice League hype train and we were gonna have our work cut out for us for sure.  Then the film came out and it was just... meh.  Like play it safe, change everything we've established Meh.  So the question was... Well what do we do with this?!  After a LOT of discussion. We decided to break the fourth wall in a sense and give our artistic expression of what the Justice League has become while also keeping true to keeping things HISHE.

Enter the Mighty Martha.  Since Justice League is the finale (pretending to be just the beginning) of this trilogy. We decided it was time for our easter egg threat that is Martha to finally enter the scene.  DC's greatest foe.  A character that represents everything the DCU now has to put up with.  A character who came from another universe and who is set on making sure the Justice League doesn't have a place to stay.  So where is the one place you can find the League with their guard down?  The Super Cafe. 

It was not easy to make and took way longer than was intended.  But I really enjoyed getting to open up our cafe in a direction we've never gone before.   I hope you enjoy the episode!

More About Bishop: Lucas Bishop is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, particularly titles associated with the X-Men. He first appears as a member of Xavier's Security Enforcers (initially called the Xavier School Enforcers), a mutant police force from a dystopian future of the Marvel Universe. He travels to the 20th century and joins the X-Men, a team he knew only as legends. An example of 1990s anti-authority antiheroes, Bishop experiences difficulty adjusting to the norms of the time period. In the mid-2000s, Bishop took on an antagonistic role over the course of several storylines.

Chained to a love, but that don’t mean much
Sensitive tough, you don’t get enough
I’ve been drowning in you, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I’ll help you up
I Don’t care to get too loud, sexy I want you now
Bet I can take you there, whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel, lets just enjoy the thrill
I’ll take over the wheel, I’ll give you the touch you’re missing
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
I like the way you take me there, I like the way you touch yourself
Don’t hold back, I want that 
when the water come down I’mma get in that 
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
As beautiful as you are, I want to light all your dark
Maybe you don’t believe in me, it’s hard to know what you see in me
Don’t be quick to say no, my chest is your pillow
Come out of the shadows, 
I know that you’re fragile
Yea

I Don’t care to get too loud, sexy I want you now
Bet I can take you there, whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel, lets just enjoy the thrill
I’ll take over the wheel, I’ll give you the touch you’re missing
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
I like the way you take me there, I like the way you touch yourself
Don’t hold back, I want that 
when the water come down I’mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe I’m up for the climb

I’m right here you know
When your waves explode
Escape the undertow
know you’ve been broken
know that  you been hoping
swimming  in your ocean
A new life is floating
The stars were made to shine
Reach up and make a wish
It’s a beautiful time
I hope you take a glimpse
We’re the sound of lovers blowing crazy in the wind
You don’t have to pretend
I don’t care where you’ve been
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
You got the vibe I’m up for the climb
I like the way you take me there, I like the way you touch yourself
Don’t move back, I want that when the water come down I’mma get in that

If you are looking for a solid pair of headphones, these five products are some of the best options on the market right now. The Bose QuietComfort 35 II is definitely our top choice, offering unparalleled noise-cancellation and sound quality.
The Sony WH-1000XM3 is another good option for those who want a versatile pair of headphones with a number of modern features. The Jaybird X4 has a durable waterproof design that is perfect for those who like to go running.
The 1MORE Triple Driver in-ear earphones are a great deal because of all the useful features at such a reasonable price. While they are a bit more expensive than other models, you certainly get your money’s worth.
While the Beats Studio3 wireless headphones are at the bottom of our list, we still commend them for their sleek design and comfortable design with dual-mode adaptive noise cancelling. Before you make a final decision, we recommend that you review each of these products closely.

From stuffed-crust pizza to the chain's legendary pan pie, our heroes learn how to make a couple of pizza-party classics without calling up the delivery guy. Then, as an ode to some of the chain's wild, international pizza offerings, Falco unveils a chorizo-topped taco pie with ""nacho-bite"" crust. Made with butter-filled dough and heaps of melted mozzarella, these throwback menu items open a portal to the pizza-party heydays of 1995. Will Andrew and Sean quit their day jobs to become fast-food pizzaiolos, or ruin their next dinner with some lack-luster cheesy crust? Watch an all new, nostalgia-packed episode of SITW and find out. And for those watching at home without a slice in hand, take comfort in the wise words of Andrew W.K.: ""Every party is a pizza party, even if there isn't pizza there.""

Lyrics:
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carols sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight

After an unfortunate encounter in the garden, Simon’s Cat goes to great lengths to avoid an imminent visit to the vet. As always, the question remains - will his long-suffering owner Simon step up to the challenge?

After a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014 to make a longer film, ‘Simon’s Cat: Off to the Vet' became the first 12 minute Simon's Cat film to be produced in full colour. 

A HUGE thank you to all our Indiegogo Supporters. This film would not have been possible without you! 

‘Simon’s Cat: Off to the Vet’ has screened at multiple film festivals around the world and was awarded The McLaren Award for Best British Animation at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2016.

FAQs:

Q. What's the background of 'Off to the Vet'?
A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com

Q. What software do you use?
A. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.

Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?
A. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.

Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?
A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop: https://shop.simonscat.com/"

""Ants Marching"" is considered to be the definitive and most recognizable Dave Matthews Band song by many of their devoted fans. The song is centered on the idea that people get caught up in the monotony of their everyday lives and forget to focus on what is truly important. The metaphor used is that people are like marching ants in the line, ""All the little ants are marching, red and black antennae waving, they all do it the same, they all do it the same way."""

Originally released just two days prior to Blonde as a visual album, Endless is an absolute fucking experience of an album. It is even more unlike anything I've heard than Blonde is, and easily his best album in terms of vibe (imo.)
This remastered version of Endless was put on his blonded.co site for Cyber Monday in 2017. It was sold in the form of a vinyl record, a CD + a DVD, and a VHS tape, along with two accompanying posters. All of them have this really cool holographic look to them.
The vinyl and CD +  DVD got delayed by a couple months but they eventually got here in early 2018.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Yo, if you want a cool community of people that like Frank Ocean and a bunch of other artists like him, check out this discord server: 
https://discord.me/futura
Discord is basically a modern chatroom with text and voice chat capabilities. There are a lot of different channels in a server for a lot of different interests that you may have (futura has a channel for music, venting, photography, production, and more as of the time that I'm writing this.) It can be kinda confusing to use at first, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
Futura is unique in that is has a monthly radio show that a member from the server makes, and we all get together to listen to it at the end of the month. They usually have really crazy transitions and stuff.
I'm no longer in the server, but the last time I linked it in my descriptions, a lot of people joined and found that the place fit them really well, so I figured I'd start that up again.
If I ever end up back in there, I'll be using the name @Marlow, so if you wanna hang out and i'm there, you know who to @.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I hold no rights or copyrights over this music. This is not my music, and I intend to make no money or profit off of this. I simply posted it here as an archive for other people to enjoy so that they can experience this beautiful album. Copyrights go to Frank Ocean and BOYS DON'T CRY. If anyone from Frank Ocean's team want me to take this down, just contact me and I'll get it down quick.

Please support the official release and spread the word. I'm unaware of where you can purchase this particular version of Endless at this moment, but I do know you can get the original video version on Apple Music still."

Full written review: TechGadgetsCanada.com

Smart digital assistants are growing in popularity, big time. In Canada, there’s really only two choices right now: Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Each brand has different versions of their assistants, usually a full size and a mini.At their core, these smart speakers/digital assistants operate largely the same no matter which size you choose, so we’ll focus this comparison on the base models; the full size Echo and Home.

Google Home vs Amazon Echo:  Who you talking to? Human or Robot?

Each of the home devices has a different Assistant personality:

Google has the Google Assistant, aka “Google”. Amazon has Alexa.

While both have female voices by default, Google Assistant has a more normal and natural sounding voice and delivery.  Alexa’s delivery is rather robotic and vaguely European even though I’ve selected Canadian English as her voice.

Will one of those voices please you more than the other? Maybe. At the moment, my preference is for Google Home.

While you have some choice for accent changes with Alexa, for the moment you don’t with Google Home. Here’s how to do it:

To change your Google assistant’s voice:

Go to Google Home -Hamburger Menu- Settings or More Settings- Preferences- Assistant Voice.

✅ Voice WINNER: Google Home

So how do you know which of these smart speakers is for you?  Here are some of the other choices you’ll have to make when deciding between Google Home and Amazon Echo.

 Do Google Home and Amazon Echo do the same tasks?

Yes. By and large these devices perform all the same basic functions:

playing music (Google Play Music, Amazon Music, Spotify)
answering questions
setting timers
controlling Smart Home gadgets like lights, thermostats, door locks and more
telling you about your day; see more below
getting news, weather and traffic info
making conversions: money, measurements, time
make phone calls
look up phone numbers (and call them)
add items to to-do lists and create reminders
make calendar appointments; depending on your OS, see below
Want to know how to talk to Google Home and Philips Hue smart lights? 

Google Home vs Amazon Echo: Are you Apple or Android?

Both Amazon Echo and and Google Home are compatible with many different smartphone platforms, including Android, Apple and more.google home speaker assistant what why how to

Google Home is definitely made to work closely with its own Pixel line of smartphones, and other Android phones and you may enjoy a more seamless experience if this is the platform you’ve got.

As far as Amazon Echo goes, the device may seem to be geared towards the Android world,  but again, there’s a lot you can do with your Apple iPhone.

Can Alexa link to Apple Calendar?

With Echo you *can* add your calendar to Alexa’s brain. She’ll integrate with Apple Calendar/iCloud, Microsoft Outlook and Office, plus the G-suite of apps and functions from Google. Want to hear about your day or list of appointments from your Apple calendar?  Alexa will tell you.

✅ Compatibility WINNER: Amazon Echo

Google Home vs Amazon Echo: Smart home control

Both Home and Echo can control your smart home devices, and the list is pretty much universal, though if you’re wondering about controlling a specific smart home toy, it’s a good idea to check it. But when it comes to door locks, lights and thermostats, they’re both pretty much the same.

If I noticed any difference its that it’s much much easier to add a single new device to Echo. For example, when I wanted to add a single new LIFX light, with Google Home I need to uninstall and reinstall the whole LIFX lineup of several bulbs, whereas with Echo, I just add the one light and it works great.

Google Home vs Amazon Alexa: Price

Amazon Echo costs $129 CAD.  Google Home is $179CAD. Given that Echo has more versatility and functionality, and it costs less, this battle goes to Alexa.

✅ Price WINNER: Amazon Echo

So who’s best? Amazon Echo or Google Home?

All things considered, Amazon Echo does more and is more versatile, speaking to different platforms and devices (not just Android) and it costs less.

If you’re looking for a smart home digital assistant and speaker to start out with Amazon Echo is the winner.

✅ OVERALL WINNER: Amazon Echo

Do you agree or disagree? Have any questions about what these devices can do? Ask in comments ."

After arriving at the airport on Tuesday and heading straight to a medical centre for his physical, Suárez went to the Ciutat Esportiva, the place where he played three seasons ago as a member of Barça B.
""It was still under construction [back then],"" he said. Later, Suárez took part in a handful of publicity events and was interviewed by the Club's media arm.
On Wednesday, it was time for his official presentation. Accompanied at all times by members of his family, Suárez officially penned his name to the new deal, took part in a press conference, and, to top it all off, he donned the Blaugrana strip and stepped out onto the pitch at Camp Nou to juggle the ball for scores of fans who came to welcome him.
Don't miss this 12-minute video, which gives an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at Denis Suárez's opening act as a member of FC Barcelona's first team.
________________

Las primeras horas de Denis Suárez como jugador del primer equipo del FC Barcelona fueron muy intensas. Todo comenzó con la llegada al aeropuerto y el desplazamiento a la clínica donde pasó las primeras pruebas médicas. Después fue a la Ciudad Deportiva, donde revivió su etapa en el filial azulgrana. ""Esto todavía estaba en construcción"", recordaba. Después de completar la revisión médica, Denis cumplió con algunos compromisos comerciales y fue entrevistado por los medios del Club.
Una vez finalizada la primera jornada, el miércoles llegó el turno de la presentación oficial. Acompañado en todo momento por sus familiares, Denis Suárez cumplió con el protocolo de la firma, la rueda de prensa y, por fin, pisó el césped del Camp Nou vestido como nuevo futbolista del FC Barcelona. En este vídeo de unos 12 minutos puedes vivir estas cargadas primeras horas del Denis azulgrana desde dentro, con imágenes inéditas, por ejemplo, acompañando al jugador en el coche.

Lyrics:

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays
We've been waiting all year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fire side
Waitng for Santa to arrive
And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmastime and
All the kids will see
The gifts under the tree

It's the best time of the year for the family
It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmastime is here
And with the blessings from above
God sends you his love
And everybody's okay
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

Lyrics:
 
I would have walked through fire
To kiss your lips
Do you still think about it
Of what you did 

Still see your old apartment 
Like a bad trip  
Wish I could forget all 
The places we've been 

Hot and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies  
And 
Now that I'm older I can see why 

Made me feel high cuz you had me so low, low low low 
You only seemed tall cuz you stunted my grow grow growth 
I only wanted you cuz I couldn't have u 
Now that I know
That wasn't love that wasn't love  
That wasn't love that wasn't love  
That was just hope 

Hope 
Hope 

Always another bender
I'd loose control  
I thought I get it back 
When you came back home to me 
Darling 
But I never had it, did I
You're heart's a trick 
And all the magic we felt 
Was just a hit 

Hot and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies  
And 
Now that I'm older I can see why 

Made me feel high cuz you had me so low, low low low 
You only seemed tall cuz you stunted my grow grow growth 
I only wanted you cuz I couldn't have u 
Now that I know
That wasn't love that wasn't love  
That wasn't love that wasn't love  
That was just hope

Hope

Subscribe to our channel : http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

After years of waiting, Star Wars The Last Jedi premiered and fans were beyond excited with the outcome of the movie. Before the credits could even roll, questions filled the minds of fans as they dissected scenes, analyzed crazy plot twists, and are already looking forward to Episode IX of Star Wars. Let’s break down each question and discover possible answers behind each one.

The final scene in Star Wars presented a lot of optimism and possibilities for the future all because of a simple broom kid. Will he train to become a Jedi? Will Rey open a new academy? How many others are out there like him? One of the biggest revelations in The Last Jedi was the death of Luke Skywalker. Will he return for Episode 9 and how much of a role will we play as a Force Ghost? In a quick moment, we see Rey has possession of all the Jedi training books. How will she use these to guide the future and become an even stronger warrior!? Finn spent a majority of the Last Jedi building a relationship with Rose. Naturally, a love triangle has formed between him, Rose, and Rey, but who will Finn chose? Princess Leia is one of the only surviving human characters from the original trilogy, but with the actress passed away, what will become of the character? Snoke’s death was a huge twist, but is he really dead? All signs point to yes. See these questions and more speculation as you watch the Biggest unanswered Last Jedi questions fans are DYING to find out!

But rather than feed the fire of an old flame, Alvin Cailan is teaming up with YouTube legend Andrew Rea (Binging With Babish) to teach people how to make both of these iconic burgers at home. Better yet, they've devised the ultimate peace treaty: a Double Shack x Double-Double Animal-style Voltron burger. It's a moment in burger history you won't want to miss.  

We're finally here to supply you with the dopest merch! We sell everything from Hot Ones Hot Sauce like the The Last Dab to the highest quality tees. Shop here: https://bit.ly/2w8lVer

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

We start our tour with the classics—Buddy's, Cloverleaf, and Loui's—before heading to some of Detroit’s newer spots like Amar Pizza and Suppino Pizzeria. And it wouldn't be a trip to Detroit without a visit to one of the most infamous pizza names to come out of the Mitten State—Little Caesars. Motown is definitely the dough town.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 3: Troye Sivan]
We're not a commercial for everyone else
We go out for coffee and keep it to ourselves
We make little homes out of three star hotels
I know what you're feeling cause I feel it as well

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

Please drink responsibly guys, seriously.  Don't let me catch you driving or some stupid bullshit after you've had one too many vespers, because your simple ass thinks that you're James Bond.  You're not James Bond, call a cab.

With select retailers like Amazon already shipping and selling CD copies of the album, fans are getting their hands on the album and finding a nice surprise when they get to the final track of the album.
Frank sings about his chosen girl before Tyler, The Creator comes in to finish the song with a verse with distorted vocals

That's right: FIVE DRINKS.

**********************************

Very first Episode of HTD: https://youtu.be/mf1ax7y0yyI
You can Pre-Order Mid-Century Cocktail here:
https://amzn.to/2Xd7lzb

This week on How to Drink I'm doing a deep dive into the Old Fashioned tracing it's evolution from the room-temperature ""Cocktail"" of the 1850's all the way up to today's spirit forward speakeasy friendly drink in 2019.  I make five drinks along the way, and truth be told there's probably a lot more I could have done with this drink (the cocktail ""schism"" that coined the name ""Old-Fashioned"" was tied to reconstruction era politics and that's a whole lot to unpack) but this episode was already twenty minutes long so I figured we save that for another day.

The 1850's Cocktail
1 sugar cube Soak with bitters
~ 2oz. -or- 60 ml. of spirit (I go with Genever here)
~ 3oz. -or- 90 ml. of Water (could be less)
Stir till sugar dissolves
Garnish with grated nutmeg (or the twist of your choice)

1860's Improved Whiskey Cocktail
2 bar-spoons of Gum Syrup
1 dash of Curaçao
1 Dash of Maraschino
1-2 dashes of Absinthe
2-4 Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Garnish with Flamed Orange Twist

1870's Old-Fashioned Cocktail
Sugar Cube soaked in Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Stir over ice
Garnish with Twist of Lemon or Orange

The Mid-Century Old-Fashioned
1 wedge of Orange
2 Maraschino Cherries
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
2 Dashes Angostura Bitters
Muddle fruit and drink together
bury in cracked ice and stir

The Modern Old-Fashioned
~ .25 -or- 8 ml. Demerara Syrup
Two Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
Stir over big ice
Garnish with Orange Twist

Lyrics

[Intro: Bootsy Collins]
Ah
Whatever goes around
Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful, baby
And look both ways
Before you cross my mind

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
Did you ever wonder?
Yeah, do you ever wonder
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just the same on the phone, no
But everybody's gotta go on, don't they?
Yes, we do, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's
When the flowers bloom

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Kali, what you mean?
I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, -brella (-brella, light)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry
'Cause your drama candid
The Tito to my Randy
Now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm...

[Bridge: Kali Uchis]
I know it's hard
But do you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah, all you had to was try

[Outro: Bootsy Collins & Kali Uchis]
Try, try, try, try, try
All you had to do was try
Try, try, try, try

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don’t you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

[Verse 2]
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

[Chorus]
And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

[Bridge]
Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, cause who's got any time for growing up
Kiss me on the mouth baby
Kiss me on the mouth baby
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free

[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don’t you wanna see a man up close
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

Based on its ability to rapidly transfer knowledge to anyone, anywhere, AR can enable humans in a way that other technologies, like robotics, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and even the web itself, cannot. In the coming years, advances in AR technology will fundamentally change how we work, how we learn, and how we live. Brian Mullins is a pioneer in the field of augmented reality, whose experience with Human Machine Interface and Computer Vision technologies enabled him to found DAQRI and develop its proprietary 4D technologies for the enterprise. Throughout his career, Brian has developed systems that employed some of the earliest vision-based mixed reality technologies. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx

It doesn't match Billboard's U.S. year-end list, since I'm basing it off of the weekly lists this year in order to more reflect what was actually popular during 2011. Because of the Billboard's early cut off date and their emphasis on chart longevity, songs that are released after August are either split between the two years or moved to the next year. I also don't want a track appearing two years in a row just because it happened to be peaking right at the cutoff. From my perspective, a song for a year-end mix belongs in the year it will be remembered from, not the year it ended its run. For instance, ""We Found Love"", which has been #1 for the last 8 weeks of the year, is nowhere to be seen in Billboard's Top 25, and may not make it next year either due to the bias of the cut-off date. As a bonus I am able to spend more time on the mixes and more fully realize them.



WORLD GO BOOM

Take, take it all
T-t-take the credit cards
Take everything tonight
Na na na come on, come on
Never gonna stop,
I'll risk it all, I'll risk it all again

Here's the situation
Got this feeling that you can't fight
Been to every nation
The city is on fire tonight
You wanted control
But you're a liar
And now everything is on fire
Don't underestimate things like this
Me and all the other kids don't give a (do-don't give a)
K-kiss kiss it all k-k-kiss it all away
If there's nothing left,

Let the world go
Boom (woohoo) boom boom boom (woohoo) boom boom

Boom boom boom boom ba doom boom boom boom
But I've got to let it go

We could have had it all
We could have had everything tonight
There's a fire starting in my heart
and I ain't afraid to show it show it show it
I just can't get enough
Ooo, burn burn burn burn burn down in flames
ignite the fire
Ooo, burn burn burn burn burn down in flames 
Like the 4th of July
Booo-ooo-ooom!

I got my pop, I got my dance I got that rock and roll
You can take everything but you can't take my soul
Never gonna stop,
I'll risk it all, I'll risk it all again
Take it all
Take the house
Take my car
Take the change in my pocket
I'm a superstar

Never gonna stop

Así lo ha confirmado Will.i.am en una entrevista que ha ofrecido a la revista de Emiratos Árabes Ahlan!

La semana pasada Variety especulaba con la posibilidad de esta ruptura, después de publicar que la estrella se quedaba en BMG, compañía con la que ha lanzado su propio sello discográfico, y dejaba el de The Black Eyed Peas.

En su último trabajo en solitario, el grupo también le había prestado apoyo, como aseguraba will.i.am, pero ahora es momento de concentrarse en proyectos diferentes. ""Hemos trabajado en varias canciones de su disco en solitario y estamos muy orgullosos de que tenga su propia casa discográfica, pero la banda seguimos adelante en contenido, tecnología y experiencias en nuestro nuevo proyecto, Masters Of The Sun"", explicaba.

Precisamente en este proyecto, la cantante Nicole Scherzinger, de Pussycat Dolls, estará participando. Pero, eso sí, el rapero no quiere hablar de reemplazo: ""no entraré en detalles sobre cuál será su participación"". Y es que será difícil que alguien pueda continuar con el éxito de Fergie.

In my junior year of high school, my class took a trip up to Stratford, Ontario to see some Shakespeare plays, and look who we see playing for money outside on the steps of the theater. Needless to say we all became early Bieber fans :)

As another year reaches its closure, we remember and honor the pop culture, the music, the stars, the good and the bad times of 2017. Thank you  for being so supportive of my work and my progress through remixing and DJing the last 10 years. Through blocked YouTube channels and disabled social media profiles, i always keep connected with you because of the music,
and a dream that keeps coming true..
Everytime i work on a PopLove mix, it starts a bit like ""Oh no, we had boring music this year..."" but it ends like ""Wow this is a celebration!! Why didnt i notice this earlier?!!""""
The music was not very high-energy this year, as ballads are making a comeback, but i tried my best to have a powerful mix, even with most songs being mid-tempo.
Its something about pop melodies that gets you hooked and hopeful. As cold as the industry often feels right now, lets re-discover the melodies and remember what music is all about, no matter the genre. THE FEELS.

Will Smith’s resume speaks for itself. For over 30 years, West Philadelphia’s favorite son has conquered music, television, and film. But after stepping away from the booth, The Fresh Prince is dusting off his crown with freestyles and an insatiable social media following. On location in Budapest, Big Willie speaks on his new music, The Fresh Prince, box office success, family, and more!"

Compromise Lyrics:

Why does it feel so hard
To give just a little trust
Feels like juggling in the dark
And all you end up is cut

Going along getting along believing
One day things will change but all you feel is

Compromise
I cannot explain it
Why we always take it
Compromise
We know what it gets us
So why don’t we just make a

Compromise
Compromise

Giving more than you can
Trying to make things work
Fighting in a ship on the ocean floor
Dying over who drowns first

Too hurt to try anymore and so you give in
Thinking one day they’ll change but all you feel is

Compromise
I cannot explain it
Why we always take it
Compromise
We know what it gets us
So why don’t we just make a

Compromise
Compromise

I don’t want to start a fire
Just to watch bridges burn
Good intentions seal our fate
When everybody takes a turn

Give what you get when you get what wasn’t given
Fighting for the last word, all you end up feeling is

Compromise
Compromise
Compromise
Compromise

Crêpes are discussed at length, in a pretty threatening manner, in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.  Before his arm is snapped by the very French Jean Girard, he's coerced into admitting he likes crêpes...which he actually does.  Which makes sense, because they're the perfect vessel for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

Lyrics:

VERSE:
It's 4AM I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed
I should just go home
 
My feet are taking me are taking me to your front door 
I know I shouldn't though
Heaven only knows 
 
PRE:
That Ooh the side effect 
To my loneliness is you 
 
CHORUS:
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
VERSE:
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with 
One too many drinks 
 
PRE:
But ooh, if late night friends 
Have consequences, cool 
 
CHORUS:
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
Ooh I think about it all the time 
Make it happen in my mind  
I'm telling you, yeah
 
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
BRIDGE:
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went lookin for a sign but instead I got a message 
I take off my pride every time we undressing 
I draw the line
I'm out of line, yeah

Thanks to the many missteps and lessons learned as well as the friends she found, the Jennifer Aniston character completely transforms herself by the end of the series. This transformation demonstrates the message of the show -- that investing in our friends and letting ourselves live the messiness of our young adult lives is the only way to grow into our authentic best selves.

These huge pussycats will leave you surprised.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-MATILDA
This feline also known as The Algonquin cat represents a historical figure in the luxurious, elegant and traditional Algonquin Hotel located in Manhattan, New York. 

-STEWIE
Despite all the members of this Top, we cannot use the phrase ""the biggest cat in the world"" without mentioning this feline. 

-SAMSON
And it seems that the felines have taken over Instagram as their second home. With more than 170 thousand followers in his account, Samson has come to fame as the biggest cat in all of New York City.

-OMAR
In Melbourne, a cat is trying to snatch the title of the largest cat, Ludo. This is Omar, an Australian Maine Coon who has become famous on its own in Instagram.

-LUDO
You can’t talk about big cats without mentioning the Maine Coons. Kelsey Gill originally wanted a cat only similar to the one that appears in the Harry Potter films; however, over time she realized that her cat was not very common.

-ARCTURUS
At just 2 years of age, this savannah cat has already broken the record for the world's tallest cat reaching 19.05 inches in height and weighing around 30 pounds. 

-SCARLETT'S MAGIC
This species of savannah had the record of the tallest cat measuring at first 16.5 inches, however, a year later it would reach more than 18 inches breaking its own mark. 

-ZEUS
When you were younger, didn’t you want to have a tiger pet? Well, Zeus is pretty close to that. Living a well-off life with its owner Morgan Lynn known for its YouTube channel Spotted Exotic this serval looks like an ordinary pet.

-SPRINKLES
A few years ago an obese cat from New Jersey caught the attention of many when it was reported as the heaviest in all of North America and possibly the world, too. 

-TIMO
This ragdoll is popular for its YouTube channel, Xiedubbel, where you can see its daily life as the lazy and playful cat that it is.

I’m so excited to share this tutorial with you. Do I have any subscribers who are Marilyn Monroe fans?! Erin is a die-hard Marilyn Monroe fan so we created this tutorial to pay an homage to Marilyn. Erin studied every detail of Marilyn’s makeup look prior to this video. I think she nailed it!

After the tutorial, there is also a very special guest who shows us some of Marilyn’s very special and personal items. It was so cool and special to experience! So, for those of you who are Marilyn fans, sit tight for that part at the end. :) Enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments section! I love reading what you guys have to say. :)

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke."""

Lyrics
I'm in the black again
Can't make it back again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

[Verse 1]
Every inch of sky's got a star
Every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
Every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

(Everything now
Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
Every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got…

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)

'Til every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La

Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)

And every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without
(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)
Every inch of space in my heart is filled with something I'll never start

The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now

Lyrics:

Wanna pack your bags, something small
Take what you need and we disappear
Without a trace we'll be gone, gone
The moon and the stars can follow the car
and then when we get to the ocean
We gonna take a boat to the end of the world
All the way to the end of the world

Oh, and when the kids are old enough
We're gonna teach them to fly

You and me together, we could do anything, Baby
You and me together yes, yes

Everybody remembers where they were on that day in 1983 when Hot Pockets first appeared. It was a giant leap into the future. A miracle some called it, for nobody could seem to say where the Hot Pockets came from. They just existed. Food, and therefore humanity, would never be the same again. The efficiency, the culinary explosion, a modern miracle that truly served as an evolutionary step for all of mankind. An entire meal in a pocket that you could hold in your hand. Joy in the streets was met by existential dread. Where could humanity go from here? Had we truly reached our civilizational zenith? Religions formed over night, some might even say cults. But then a second flavor appeared. And then a third. And now over fifty, each richer and more complex than the last. Since that day in 1983, humanity has been on the precipice of our next phase of being, but for one obstacle in the way. How are you supposed to eat a Hot Pocket without burning the hell out of the inside of your mouth? I mean, come on. It’s crazy hot, but it’s seriously impossible to wait just five minutes until it comes out of the microwave. No, I need it now. Give me that Hot Pocket.

Hey my lovelies! In today's video I thought I would do something a little bit different.. I decided to turn into Kylie Jenner for a week. I thought this would be quite interesting as we have such different lifestyles, fashion senses and general looks. It was really fun to have a different look for a whole week and experience new things I wouldn't usually think to do. I also loved trying to recreate Kylie's looks on a budget! Let me know if you'd like to see more videos like this!

Support ScreenPrism on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=7792695

The most prominent philosophical value in Westeros is honor. But we've seen that many characters think being honorable is stupid in this cruel world that requires characters to be cunning and adapt. Ned's honor is answered decisively through his fate. Yet over time Jon and Sansa prove that it's possible to practice versions of Intelligent Honor, and that in the long run certain honorable behaviors can be truly smart.

This is my go to makeup in the last few weeks. I couldn’t do more, even if I wanted to because there was no time. 
Fashion Week is over ( thank God! ) so I will be a bit more adventurous with makeup as I  think I’ll have more time. 

For International Women’s Day , I’ve created a really cool, sexy look, I have posted on my Instagram only ( @aliandreeamakeup ), because I initially thought I’d do something  quick, like red lips or so, but then it turned out to be a very successful look so if you wanna see it, it’s up on my Instagram. I did not record  it with sound else I would have definitely  upload that on YouTube as well. 


Hope you like this simple look and don’t forget to comment and tell me what is your 5 minutes makeup routine. 

Thank you for watching !
❤️

YOU WANNA BE FRIENDS?

LYRICS 

I never really feel a thing I’m just kinda too froze 
You were the only one that even kinda came close 
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose 
I woke up no luck, I woke up no luck 
And when your stich comes loose 
I want to sleep on every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you 
I took too many hits off this memory 
I need to come down. 
Another day goes by so hold me tight 
or don’t. 
Oh no this isn’t how our story ends, so hold me tight, or don’t 
I got too high again when I realized I cant not be with you 
Or be just your friend 
I love you to death but I just cant pretend we were lovers first 
Confidants but never friends 
were we ever friends? 
Cause I’m past the limits 
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife

After graduation, it seems like most of us only remember the bad teachers we were forced to deal with; the ones who assigned unrelenting amounts of homework, or specialized in giving pop quizzes about subjects that were barely covered in class. But there are some incredible teachers out there doing amazing work, and these are the teachers that we are going to be focusing on in this video. By the time you’re done, you’ll wish that you could go back in time and redo your school career with one of these incredible teachers. While most students have to be begged to practice their instruments for band, one boy in Afghanistan reached out to a very special teacher who taught him despite an eight and a half hour time difference. When one professor became overwhelmed by the amount of repetitive questions asked by his students, he decided that a quick and simple solution was to create an artificially intelligent teaching assistant who was able to quickly and accurately answer questions without his students being any the wiser. One teacher had a reputation among his students for being rather firm when it comes to discipline, so they were shocked to learn that in his off time he volunteered at the hospital cuddling sick children. Many kids find it hard to comprehend that their teachers have lives outside the classroom, but one class was really shocked when it turned out their teacher was working on becoming a professional wrestler in his spare time.

-----------------------------------------------------------
This year, from April to August, was the darkest time, but also the transformational moment of my life when this channel, ""AnDyWuMUSICLAND,"" literally came from death to life. We've learnt how to ""Fight For Love"" in 2015, how to deal with the loss when ""We Were Young"" in 2016, but every time, in next phase of our lives, there are always different, unexpected challenges for us to confront.

The most important thing is: how do we deal with the struggle? When I was trapped in the hard feelings and asking ""what have I done,"" ""why did this world do this to me?"" I almost didn't wanna fight anymore. I truly said a couple of times that ""I wouldn’t do mashups anymore."" and ""There's no way I would release Mashup 2017."" However, seeing how Ariana Grande fought against the terrorists with ""One Love Manchester"" gave me the whole new point of view. I realized that we could be sad, scared and devastated, but after all, we still need love, music, and connections with people to give us a cathartic experience. That's how we become  and stronger.

""If we never learn, we been here before. Why are we always stuck and running from the bullets?"" We cannot choose the challenges we are faced with, but if there's love, we can steer how it goes. In the end, we all have to thank, ""Perfect Struggle,"" to make us perfect, and move on to the next stage of life.

(In August, I also made a short film called ""Reconnection,"" directed & written by me, using an abstract way to express the intimate feeling of me during the dark time. And this film will be premiered on this channel soon as well. Hope you will like it!)

There are 6 stages of ""Perfect Struggle”--
I. Cultivate 0:09
II. Struggle 1:43 (""Heavy"": in memory of Chester Bennington)
III. Heal 3:15
IV. Intensify 5:51
V. Relive 7:07
VI. Perfect 8:22

So, needless to say, we were curious to see what he'd make of our ridiculous interview format, where each question is accompanied by an increasingly spicy chicken wing. His take on the experience: ""This is a nightmare, dude.""

Not only did the players and fans celebrate the 23rd Liga title, but they also gave a very special tribute to the player with the record number of appearances for the club, Xavi Hernández. After 17 seasons, the Catalan midfielder is finally departing, and our cameras followed him from the moment he left home right through to kick-off against Deportivo, with the supporters unfurling a huge banner in his honour.

“I’ll get nervous when I see all my family and friends” he confesses in this very special video memento of the day the club offered a heartfelt send-off to one of the greatest players ever to wear its famous shirt.
_____________

La jornada del sábado en el Camp Nou fue muy especial para todo el Barça. Se celebraba la 23ª Liga y se despedía con todos los honores el jugador que más veces ha vestido la camiseta azulgrana. Xavi Hernández jugaba su último partido de Liga y se despedía del Estadio que la ha disfrutado durante las últimas 17 temporadas. Era un día señalado para Xavi, y él era consciente. En este vídeo le acompañamos desde que sale de su domicilio en dirección al Camp Nou hasta los instantes previos al partido contra el Deportivo, cuando el Estadio le dedicó un 'tifo' de homenaje.

En este vídeo de nueve minutos puedes seguir Xavi desde dentro de su coche y vivir con él las sensaciones previas a una jornada de lo más emocionante. ""Me pondré nervioso cuando vea toda mi familia y mis amigos"", confesaba el capitán en el trayecto hacia el Camp Nou. No te pierdas uno de los despedidas más especiales y vívelo desde dentro.

La jornada de dissabte al Camp Nou va ser molt especial per a tot el Barça. Se celebrava la 23a Lliga i s’acomiadava amb tots els honors el jugador que més vegades ha vestit la samarreta blaugrana. Xavi Hernández jugava el seu últim partit de Lliga i s’acomiadava de l’Estadi que l’ha gaudit durant les últimes 17 temporades. Era un dia assenyalat per a Xavi, i ell n’era conscient. En aquest vídeo l’acompanyem des que surt del seu domicili en direcció al Camp Nou fins als instants previs al partit contra el Deportivo, quan l’Estadi li va dedicar un ‘tifo’ d’homenatge.

En aquest vídeo de nou minuts pots seguir Xavi des de dins del seu cotxe i viure amb ell les sensacions prèvies a una jornada d’allò més emocionant. “Em posaré nerviós quan vegi tota la meva família i els meus amics”, confessava el capità en el trajecte cap al Camp Nou. No et perdis un dels comiats més especials i viu-lo des de dins.

But which international noodle brand reigns supreme? To help Sean Evans unpack the increasingly intricate world of mass-market noodle bowls, he's enlisted the help of Andrew and David Fung, the stars of the wildly popular YouTube channel Fung Bros. While taste-testing noodles from across East Asia, Sean, Andrew, and David slurp up instant soba from Japan before sampling Samyang's hot chicken flavor ramen—a dish made famous by last year's viral ""Korean Fire Noodle Challenge."" Finally, the guys taste-test Ichiran's ultra-luxe ramen kit before stepping into the Japanese chain's legendary solo dining booths. Does complete isolation really enhance the noodle-slurping experience? Is it ever worth dropping $39 on a three-pack of instant ramen? Is the Fire Noodle Challenge really all it's cracked up to be? Find out the answers to these important questions—and more!—on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

A United Airlines pilot was tardy to her flight Saturday and arrived in civilian clothing, getting on the loudspeaker and ranted about her divorce and politics. According to reports, about 20 passengers disembarked the plane saying they didn't feel safe with her as the pilot. ""Ok, if you don't feel safe, get off the airplane,"" the pilot said. ""I'll stop and I won't fly the airplane. Don't worry. I'm going to let my co-pilot fly it. He's a man. Ok?"""

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since Kylie Jenner is constantly on social media, it seems like it’d be hard for her to keep anything a secret. But there are a few dark ones lurking behind the shining facade of her Kylie Cosmetics company. We’ll let you in on some of the issues that have plagued the Kardashian family and their various businesses. Kylie caused a ton of controversy by selling extremely pricey makeup brushes, but did they live up to the hype? We know her products are expensive, but how do they stack up against cheaper brands such as Colourpop? Recently, some employees have come forward and made some serious accusations about working in Kylie’s factory, even going as far as to compare it to working in a sweatshop! Did these facts make you think twice about shopping Kardashian for all your makeup needs? Tell us in the comment section, then click on the subscribe button for the latest videos from TheTalko.

But how is he with hot food? Find out as the Miami rap legend takes on the wings of death and discusses everything from partying with Jeremy Shockey, to hip-hop's enduring love affair with Benihana. As the spice builds and he sends up a prayer to make it through the challenge, Trick also opens up the influence of www.thug.com, his Miami spring-break tips, and his suspicions about self-driving cars. If you loved Hot Ones in the early days, you'll love this episode with a hip-hop O.G.

Often the center of the community, diners built in the 1920's are still beloved by their guests despite modern restaurants filling up Main Street. Zagat editor Billy Lyons visited three diners in the Garden State to find out why this style of dining and cuisine continues to thrive - not to mention investigate a fun food debate.

But what about a spider on a weather cam? Or a wisecracking co-anchor? Get your umbrella ready, because these are the meteorologists who lost it on live TV.

In May 2019, a tornado shredded the streets of Dayton, Ohio. Luckily, locals can't say the alarms weren't sounded, according to Newsweek, thanks to FOX 45's weatherman, Jamie Simpson.

But not everyone was happy about it. Simpson's live report, made several hours before the tornadoes rushed through, cut into an airing of The Bachelorette.

Rather than ignore the social media fire, Simpson flipped out.

The tornado ended up claiming one life, destroying a large part of central Ohio, and injuring twelve, according to Today. When Simpson's clip went viral, Dayton locals praised him for his dedication.

It’s crazy to think that now I’ve created a look on her! To top it off, we created this look using not only her brand new product, but also ‘the girls’ eyeshadow palette from the desixkaty dose of colors collection! It was so much fun filming this video with Kim. I hope you guys love this look!

Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don’t you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

[Verse 2]
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

[Chorus]
And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

[Bridge]
Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, cause who's got any time for growing up
Kiss me on the mouth baby
Kiss me on the mouth baby
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free

[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don’t you wanna see a man up close
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don’t bite

Young and full of running
Tell me where's that taking me?
Just a great figure 8 or a tiny infinity

Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying
You still end up dying
How can it be?

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

So young and full of running, all the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming,
""I have to have you now""
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on yours

Don't say a word just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

Disney's Cinderella has gotten a lot of hate for giving girls a bad role model. But does the movie really deserve this hate? Dismissing Cinderella blames a victim of abuse for her situation and devalues stereotypically feminine traits like kindness, optimism and resourceful imagination.

I am gonna show you
The world, and all that you desire
I said I, I don't wanna control you
I wanna set you free, just come with me
Oh, and I know, yeah
I know you sense a pleasure in my eye
As long as you know, baby
Every pleasure you taste has its price, babe
Oh, I don't wanna say I told you so, oh
But I told you so, no
I don't wanna say I told you so
But I told you so

Watch this video on my site http://www.lisae.me.uk/16253 for product links, tips and more info.

Many people have asked me what, in my opinion, are the best high street make-up products. I thought the best place to look would be my pro kit as I expect a high level of quality, technology and pigments from all the items in there. 

Each product I've chosen to mention is here for a different reason. Some have impressed me with their fantastic shades, more expected of a premium or pro brand. Others are here because the quality or colour range is exceptional for the very reasonable price and a couple are here because they utilise the very latest technology, in keeping with the most expensive brands around.

 All in all i'd be happy to use any of these products on an A-list client and i cant say fairer than that! x

I can’t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try."

Thin, bushy, tattooed: Our intrepid eyebrows have been through it all. That's why we’re paying them the ultimate homage by packing 100 years of brows in under five minutes—with the help of makeup artist and eyebrow specialist Maribeth Madron. Of course by now we’ve mastered the art of the perfect brow. Getting here was a long road, with plenty of sparse zones and wiry strays along the way. While power brows are in right now—we're looking at you, Brooke Shields, our patron saint of arches —a full natural brow wasn't always appreciated in the beauty world. In fact, eyebrow trends have changed a lot over the past century, and this compilation of looks throughout the years will show you the startling versatility of the humble facial feature.
It all starts with the unforgettable paper-hin brows of the 1920s, courtesy of screen siren Clara Bow, then moves to the tapered arched brows of the '50s, all the way to the Cara Delevingne–esque brows we're all currently obsessed with. However, as the video plays on you’ll see that it’s not just the shape of eyebrows that has changed. With each new trend comes new tools. In the ‘80s, brow gels helped women achieve full, feathered styles, and waxing grew in popularity during the '90s. (Yeesh. Remember that?) Then there are also the more peculiar trends, like the stack of eyebrow rings at the 2014 Rodarte show or the colorful stains that have probably filled your Instagram feed—if not your own arches—as of late.

WITH GRAHAM NORTON at 11/10c.
 
The UK's biggest, most outrageous talk show has returned for its 10th season with must-see guests: Oscar winner Robin Williams, actor Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, Wilfred), iconic comedienne Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) and British boyband JLS. As always, expect Norton's trademark comedy monologues and eccentric stories.
 
Here, Robin Williams discusses a mortifying omission as he accepted his Oscar in 1998 for Good Will Hunting - sorry, Mom! And Hobbit extraordinaire Elijah Wood recalls a hysterical encounter with Hollywood legend (and proud non-Ring-er) Jack Nicholson backstage at the Golden Globes... complete with dead-on, laugh-out-loud impressions.
 
Don't miss all new episodes of The Graham Norton Show, every Saturday at 10/9c. For more on The Graham Norton Show: visit http://www.bbcamerica.com/the-graham-norton-show/
 
The Graham Norton Show presented by the Ministry of Laughs, BBC America's Saturday night comedy block. Coming soon to the Ministry of Laughs: That Mitchell and Webb Look, Katy Brand's Big Ass Show, Peep Show, The Thick of It, and more.

Including some of the biggest hits of the year and a special part at the end  
This year has been a bit different for me about mashups, after my third channel got deleted last year I wasn’t motivated to keep making mashups but then I remembered that it’s something that I like, it’s a hobby and that I’m not doing this just for views so I decided to create a new one.
This year I started great with my channel, but I started to be busier with the school, then after Chester’s death I was very sad and it was like I wasn’t  really interested in the music releases, his death was really one of the worst things of the year.
2 months ago I started with the idea of a year-end but I wasn’t very updated with the music, so I thought that I wouldn’t be uploading one this year but after watching some mashups and megamixes I got inspired and finally decided to make one, in my opinion this year’s music was really bad but hopefully next year will be better.
Hope you like this! Can’t wait for next year! :)

Lyrics:

Dancing with your silhouette
In the places that we met
Oooo tryna find you in the moon
Paris never feels the same
When the streets all call your name
Ooo so I hide in crowded rooms
 
And I’ll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you
 
Once upon a time we had it all
And somewhere down the line we went and lost it
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I’m broken here tonight and darling
No-one else can fix me
Only you
Only you
Oh no one else can fix me
Only you
Only you
Only You
Oh no one else can fix me
Only you
 
Did I let go of your hand
For a castle made of sand
Oooo that fell into the blue
I went following the sun
To be alone with everyone
Oooo looking round a crowded room
And ill follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you
 
Once upon a time we had it all
And somewhere down the line we went and lost it
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I’m broken here tonight and darling
No one else can fix me
Only you
Only you
And no one else can fix me
Only you
Only you
Only You
And no one else can fix me
Only you
Ah

Plus, the man has loads of connections to major motion pictures and tons of experience crafting combat robots. Let's geek out and discover the truth about Grant Imahara from MythBusters.

In 2010, Grant Imahara promised to build a part of television history and then he followed through on that promise. It all began as such things often do on Twitter. According to Entertainment Weekly, Imahara had noticed that Craig Ferguson, the former host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, had taken to calling his Twitter followers his, quote, ""robot skeleton army.""

One thing quickly led to another. As Imahara told the Star-Advertiser, 

 ""At some point, they put two and two together and said, 'He should have a robot skeleton sidekick.""

Imahara would prove to be just the man to build it but there was a catch: The talk show host had to drive Imahara's Twitter followers over the magic line of 100,000. Ferguson quickly rose to the challenge.

According to Popular Mechanics, Imahara found his part of the deal considerably more difficult to deliver. He tinkered with the robot while shooting MythBusters, which meant precious little time for sleep and a huge rush to get everything done in time. Popular Mechanics reports that Imahara soon found himself in something of a bind with only one week before the deadline, 

""He still needed to write the software that would make Geoff move, and build Ferguson's control box.""

Despite his struggles with the project, Imahara managed to deliver on his promise big time.

The end result was Geoff Peterson, a snarky, remote-controlled skeleton. The creation became so popular it even has its own Wikipedia entry and ironically, that entry is significantly longer than Imahara's.

Ferguson absolutely loved Geoff Peterson. And shortly after Ferguson left The Late Late Show in 2014, Imahara took to Twitter to give fans a much-needed update on everyone's favorite robot skeleton sidekick:

""For everyone who's asked me 'What happened to Geoff?' I can report that he is safely with Craig in his personal office!""

And no wonder.  Keep watching the video to see the untold truth of Grant Imahara from MythBusters!

Star Wars Ep. 8 The Last Jedi is getting praised by critics but mixed reactions from fans. What is the hidden agenda of The Last Jedi that makes it the boldest, most surprising, and most polarizing Star Wars film? Erik Voss explains the deeper meaning of The Last Jedi, how it connects every storyline, and how the Finn & Rose storyline on Canto Bight feels removed from the rest of the film. Is The Last Jedi too long? What is the significance of the film's final scene? Is it fair to say Rian Johnson betrayed J.J. Abrams vision in The Force Awakens, and George Lucas' vision of the characters in Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back... and is that a good thing?

After 22 seasons at the Club and 16 years in the senior side - in which he played a total of 674 matches and scored 57 goals -, the Barça captain said goodbye to the Stadium and fans after Barça’s win against Real Sociedad (1-0).

Iniesta’s name was chanted throughout the game and the entire Stadium rose as one to acclaim him when he left the pitch for the last time. After the match, he was given a special tribute, which included his team-mates making a guard of honour whilst all wearing his No.8 shirt.

In the following video, we take a look at Iniesta’s final week at the Club from the inside. His last game, the trip to South Africa to play the friendly for the centenary of Nelson Mandela's birth, his last training session at the Ciutat Esportiva, the tribute on Friday at the Camp Nou with many special guests... All this and much more, in a video not to be missed!

How Does She Spoil Her Kids and Kanye West? 
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kim Kardashian is one of the most influential people on the planet and fans can’t seem to get enough of her. And with 146 million followers, she’s also one of the most followed accounts on Instagram. Her designer duds, flashy jewelry, and expensive makeup have a lot of her fans shook. But naturally, she’s living life on a whole different level and spends her money as fast as she makes it. But when your net worth is an estimated $370 million, the sky’s the limit. 

If you don’t follow Kim’s every move, you’ll be surprised to learn that the reality star doesn’t just splurge on herself and her family. Sometimes she helps people who are locked up in jail. From wearing the world’s finest clothes to flying private jets all around the globe, Kim is living the life. But that’s not much of a surprise given that her momager, Kris Jenner and her late dad, Robert Kardashian were totally loaded. So, they instilled a taste for the finer things in life in the beauty mogul and her sisters. 

But just because she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, doesn’t mean she didn’t work her butt off to get to where she is now. And when you’re as rich and as successful as she is, you don’t really have to worry about ever going broke. Kim didn’t just sit on her laurels and borrowed her mom’s credit cards. She’s been raking in the cash from her show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” as well as her perfumes, KKW beauty line, and kimojis. So, if she wants to spend her spare time splurging, she’s definitely earned it.

If you like comics and celebrity interviews, this is your show. Each week we’re joined by a new guest, who hits up a local comic book shop with host Jon Schnepp and peruses the wares while also discussing their career, upcoming projects, and of course their favorite comic books.
 
In this episode, will.i.am reveals that his background in comics came from hip hop groups like Soul Sonic Force and Wu Tang Clan using comics art on their album covers and discusses about how that influenced the Black Eyed Peas graphic novel Masters of the Sun. will.i.am and Taboo talk about choosing to set the comic in the 80s, having lived through the crack cocaine epidemic, and borrowing from historical facts and conspiracy theories to create this zombie-centric comic. They also discuss other comics that have influenced them, from Red Wolf to Iron Man, Schnepp offers some suggestions for comic books they might like, and they talk about toys, figures, and recent superhero movies like Spider-Man: Homecoming as well as Taboo’s love of The Walking Dead.

For a long time, one of my worst habits was drinking energy drinks. I'd drink two or three a day - and I HATED the fact that I did it, but I couldn't stay disciplined enough to quit. I kept doing it for years.

Finally, I got fed up enough with the consequences to finally give the habit up once and for all.

In this video, I'll share some of the techniques that helped me break this habit - and many others since. Whatever your bad habits are, you'll be able to use these strategies to quit them as well.

My book ""10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades"" is completely free, so check it out if you're interested in improving your grades!

Alas, my report wasn't accepted, but I still think this is very important information to consider for creators industry professionals, and even fans. Where do we want digital comics to take us in the future?

What I do here is explain how to read comics, both print and digital using comiXology, and then go about highlighting some of the issues that I have with the digital comics experience. Size, confusing Guided View reading, and digital translation are my three biggest issues, as you'll see in the video. Comment if you want to be a part of the conversation!"

Lyrics: 
Take a trip into my garden
I’ve got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

And it’s true, baby
I’ve been saving this for you, baby

I guess it’s something like a fun fair 
Put gas into the motor
And boy I’ll meet you right there
We’ll ride the rollercoaster

Cause it’s true, babe
I been saving this for you, baby

(I need you to)
Tell me right before it goes down
(Promise me you’ll)
Hold my hand if I get scared now
(Might tell you to)
Take a second baby slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I boom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Come on baby play me like a love song 
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Now it’s the perfect season 
Yeah, let’s go for it this time
We’re dancing with the trees and
I’ve waited my whole life

It’s true, baby
I been saving this for you, baby

(I need you to)
Tell me right before it goes down
(Promise me you’ll)
Hold my hand if I get scared now
(Might tell you to)
Take a second baby slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I boom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Come on baby play me like a love song 
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Just for you 
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you

Baby, baby, I’ve been saving this for you, baby
Baby, baby, I’ve been saving this for you, baby

(Yeah I boom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Come on baby play me like a love song 
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Just for you 
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
Just for you

If you love street food videos and street food vlogs, this street food compilation is going to make you hungry for more! You can travel here with us through this travel vlog and discover 7 amazing street foods of Mexico city. 

To start the day, we went for a Mexican breakfast, found on the street corner. 
Here, we tried the tamales, a corn flour stuffed with chicken and a green salsa verde. It was spicy and heavenly! 

After this, we went for more Mexican street food, and ate the Carnitas. They were stuffed with pork belly and organs and you can cover them in lime and lots of nice spicy salsa, very delicious! The street stands all throughout Mexico city are amazing!!

After this we went to the famous coyoacan Market in Mexico city to try delicious shrimp and ceviche tostadas! They were so crispy and delicious! 

There are so many street foods in this video! After that we tried spicy and salty grasshoppers, and then moved on for more tacos from heaven! 

To finish the day, we had 2 more types of tacos. The al pastor tacos and then some delicious brain, eye, and tongue tacos from a street fast food stand.

Here are the addresses for the street foods in this video:

1) Tamale Corn Flour Stuffed with Chicken and Salsa Verde - You can find these spicy Tamales all over the city, but the one we found was on the corner of Paseo de la reforma and Basilio badillo street.

2) Pork Carnitas  at Rincon Tarasco  Av. José Martí 14,  Colonia Escandón

3 and 4) Fish Ceviche and Shrimp Tostadas and Grasshoppers found at the Coyoacan market in Mexico City

5) MASSIVE Machete Tacos/ Quesadillas  at Los Machetes

6) Tacos Al Pastor  -You can find these Tacos everywhere in Mexico city, so delicious! We found our  Al Pastor tacos at Taqueria Escandon. 

7) Brain, Tongue, Eye, and Suadero Tacos at El Paisa de Escandón - José Martí 104 Col. Escandón, Gral. Francisco Murguía

Lyrics: 

Come and see
I swear by now i'm playing time
I against my troubles
I'm coming slow but speeding
Do you wish a dance and while i'm
In the front
The play on time is won
But the difficulty is coming here
I will go in this way
And find my own way out
I wont tell you to stay
But i'm coming to much more
Me
All at once the ghosts come back
Reeling in you now
What if they came down crushing
Remember when i used to play for
All of the loneliness that nobody
Notice now
I'm begging slow i'm coming here
Only waiting i wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads my way
I'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head
Please, i wouldnt pass this by
I would take any more than
What sort of man goes by
I will bring water
Why wont you ever be glad
It melts into wonder
I came in praying for you
Why wont you run
In the rain and play
Let the tears splash all over you

Welcome back to another episode of That Cost How Much?! The series where we try DIYing expensive decor that we see at some of our fav stores. We decided to tackle an especially over priced item, and that item is plant stands. Although we love the way they look, why should we have to break the bank?? These are all super simple and we'd love to see you recreate them. Let us know what stores or items you'd like to see us try next time in the comments below!

And then one day in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen her life changed forever. Her eyes are open and now she has ascended to Pocky level: Tsubu Tsubu (Strawberry Flakes), a level that it usually takes decades to reach. With her work in making a gourmet version of four flavors of Pocky - Chocolate, Matcha, Cookies & Cream and Strawberry Flakes - she is quickly climbing ever upwards in the Pocky Movement. Join Claire as she seeks Pocky Perfection.

While struggling through the wings of death, the comedian pulls back the curtain on the Eric Andre show, discusses his off-piste rap career, and explains the art of wearing a jumpsuit with your face on it. He also tries out some unconventional techniques to tame the heat, including ""weird vitamins"" and a pre-show cryotherapy session. Thanks for rocking with us through 100 episodes, Hot Ones fans!

Lyrics
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby,
Do you recognize me?
Well,
It's been a year,
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, I love you,
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Lyrics:
[Intro: H.E.R.]
Oh, ey

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus 1: H.E.R.]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
This life is a movie
But you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
It's the sunrise
And those brown eyes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus 2: Daniel Caesar]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol that I take when my head hurt
You're the sunshine of my life

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

[Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you

Subscribe to the Olympic channel: http://bit.ly/1dn6AV5

""I don't know why I cried. This is the first time,"" the new Olympic figure skating champion Kim Yu-Na told reporters after stepping off the rink. But everyone present at Vancouver's Pacific Coliseum Arena understood why, after witnessing one of the greatest performances and most inspirational evenings in Olympic Winter Games history.

The 19-year-old Korean, dancing to Gershwin's Concerto in G, delivered a mesmerising show of elegance and athleticism. She landed an opening triple lutz-triple toe combination, followed by a perfect triple flip and double axel-double toe-double loop, but just as dazzling as her huge jumps were the breathtaking grace, precision and artistry of the performance. 

It earned her a colossal 150.06 points in her free programme, for a world record score of 228.56. Kim's artistry was so exceptional that Japan's Mao Asada was more than 23 points behind in second despite landing two triple Axels.

""She didn't miss a step,"" said Kim's Canadian coach Brian Orser, himself a former Olympic medallist. ""She was skating with her heart. I just wanted her to have an Olympic moment. I wanted it to be Olympic and not cautious, not hold back, just go out and embrace the space, and the Olympic Games.""

The bronze medal was won by Canada's Joannie Rochette, who, following her courageous skate in the short programme, had the strength to turn in another remarkable performance just four days after the death of her mother, earning standing ovations from the crowd both before and after her skate. After she had finished, the 24-year-old from Quebec put her hands together and blew a kiss towards the skies.

""I feel proud and the result did not matter. It was a lifetime project for me and my mom, and we achieved that,"" she said, adding: ""She was always proud of me. She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way.""

Small wonder that on such an emotionally-charged night, the once-impassive Kim should be moved to tears.

""Three times,"" answered Kim, asked how many times she had cried since winning the gold. ""After my performance was over and then on the podium. [Joannie Rochette] started crying, and I started crying right with her.""

Yep, “staring contests” are a real thing.  One of the world records for time without blinking was set - 40 minutes and 59 seconds. Actually, contestants use some clever tricks to achieve this kind of endurance. 

But why is blinking so important for our eyes? Mostly because they need to be moisturized all the time. Also, every time you blink, your brain finishes processing one portion of information, and gets ready to process the next one. An average person blinks more than 21,000 times a day, that’s one blink every 2 to 3 seconds. So what will happen if you stop blinking?

SUMMARY:
- There are but they’re strictly banned in most competitions and shouldn’t be used without asking a doctor first. Participants of staring competitions use yawning instead. 
- Another trick is in squinting. If you can’t fully close your eyes, at least squint them to keep them from hurting.
- The record setter, Eyesore, came out of this battle victorious. But he likened the feeling to getting a tattoo on his eyeballs.
- Little babies don’t blink as frequently as an adult person. When you read books or watch TV, you also blink much less often, even though your eyes experience extra stress. And finally, fighter jet pilots, while they’re in training simulations, blink frequently in friendly territories and less frequently in hostile situations. 
- Every time you blink, your brain finishes processing one portion of information, and gets ready to process the next one. This is why pilots blink more often when they don’t need to concentrate as much. 
- An average person blinks more than 21,000 times a day, that’s one blink every 2 to 3 seconds. That means you spend around 36 minutes a day in a blackout just because of blinking. 
- Eye blinks only look like they have no particular order, but they happen only when they’re needed to reload information or moisten the eyes. Even if you don’t want to blink – your brain will make you do it sooner or later. 
- So what will happen if you stop blinking? The damage would start almost immediately. As soon as your eyeballs start to dry out, tiny particles will settle down on their surface and start to scratch it.
- Eventually, your eyesight will lose all sharpness because of the cornea’s drying out. The final result would be irreversible damage that may cause you to lose your eyesight altogether.

Do you like comics and celebrities who also happen to like comics? You’re in luck! We at Collider have a variety of original shows ranging from panel-style Movie Talk to the more utility-based Best Movies on Netflix, and now we’re happy to introduce a brand new show for our channel: Comic Book Shopping. Each episode will find a different celebrity or personality going to a local comics shop with host Jon Schnepp and sifting through and discussing their favorite comics, as well as their own upcoming projects. 
 
In this week’s episode Batalon, who’s unforgettable as Peter Parker’s BFF Ned Leeds in the Sony Pictures/Marvel Studios film, teams up with Schnepp and goes to Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles, where the two peruse the aisles talk about Batalon’s experience making Homecoming, hanging out with folks like Tom Holland, Martin Starr, and Donald Glover, and if he wants to see Ned follow his comics arc and become the Hobgoblin.  
 
Batalon also opens up about his love of Star Wars comics as a kid (and nerds out over some Star Wars comics in the store) while Schnepp offers some great suggestions to expand the horizons of those who may be a bit newer to the comics realm. And Batalon even teases his role in Terry Gilliam’s long-awaited The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.
 
Check out the fourth episode of Comic Book Shopping in the video above, and if you missed our previous episodes check out our chats with Preacher executive producer Evan Goldberg, Linkin Park, and Silicon Valley's Martin Starr: http://bit.ly/2spC8Nn.

Monday’s training session, Barcelona‘s first and last at the 105,000 seat behemoth, was the first preseason workout of the season for goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen, who arrived in Dallas on Sunday night, and met his teammates at the hotel.

After Tuesday’s game, Barça will head to the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday for the final stop on this summer’s US Tour.

I posted a poll on both the YT channel and on Reddit and received over 2,000 votes. It was pretty clear that the Old Fashioned was the most popular by a long shot.

CHECK OUT THE POLL RESULTS HERE: https://stevethebartender.com.au/5-most-popular-classic-whiskey-cocktails/

OLD FASHIONED

The ‘modern’ version of the old fashioned was thought to be created back in the 1880s at the Pendennis Club when a patron asked for a drink in the Old Fashioned way. The bartender created a bittered sling but served it over ice and with a twist of orange, therefore creating the old fashioned.

- 60mL Bourbon / Rye Whiskey (2 oz)
- 2 Dashes of Angostura
- Sugar Cube
- Orange Twist

WHISKEY SOUR

The whiskey sour was first printed on a menu back in 1856 and was originally served over crushed ice. It wasn’t until the 1890s that the egg white was incorporated.

- 60mL Bourbon Whiskey (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 22.5mL Simple Syrup (1:1) (¾ oz)
- Egg White
- Dash of Angostura

MANHATTAN

The back story of the Manhattan is a little hazy but we are led to believe that it was created at New York’s Manhattan Club back in the 1880s.

- 60mL Rye Whiskey (2 oz)
- 30mL Sweet Vermouth (1 oz)
- 2 Dashes of Angostura
- Maraschino Cherry

SAZERAC

The Sazerac is believed to be created in New Orleans in 1850 by the creator of Peychaud’s Bitters which is still used within the drink to this day. The original recipe called for cognac but there was a shortage on grapes 15 years on and the drink was then made using rye whiskey.

- 60mL Rye Whiskey (2 oz)
- 2 Dashes of Peychauds Bitters
- 1 Sugar Cube
- Absinthe Rinse

IRISH COFFEE

The Irish Coffee was first made in the 1940s by an Irish bartender for Americans. He slipped in a nip of whiskey into each coffee and when they questioned “is this Brazilian coffee” he exclaimed “no, it’s Irish Coffee” and the name stuck.

- 45mL Irish Whiskey (1½ oz)
- 2 Tsp of Brown Sugar
- Hot Coffee
- Pouring Cream

My camera is broken and is putting 'noise' (moving dots) into my brows and hairline. Its a recognised and common fault on this type of camera (Canon 5D). Its been happening for a while and Ive tried to correct it but its getting worse. I've used this exact camera since my very first video seven years ago but I guess I'll need to invest in a new one soon. Sorry if the movement spoiled your viewing... I will upgrade my camera soon!

LYRICS: 
Take a trip into my garden
I’ve got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

And it’s true, baby
I’ve been saving this for you, baby

I guess it’s something like a fun fair  
Put gas into the motor
And boy I’ll meet you right there
We’ll ride the rollercoaster

Cause it’s true, babe
I been saving this for you, baby

(I need you to)
Tell me right before it goes down
(Promise me you’ll)
Hold my hand if I get scared now
(Might tell you to)
Take a second baby slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I boom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Come on baby play me like a love song 
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom), just for you

Now it’s the perfect season 
Yeah, let’s go for it this time
We’re dancing with the trees and
I’ve waited my whole life

It’s true, baby
I been saving this for you, baby

(I need you to)
Tell me right before it goes down
(Promise me you’ll)
Hold my hand if I get scared now
(Might tell you to)
Take a second baby slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I boom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you

Come on baby play me like a love song 
Every time it comes on

Taking his already astounding career to the next level in helping champion new music via his own avenue, Lost Frequencies is proud to announce Found Frequencies, his own, debut label distributed by Armada Music that will release its first track ‘Crazy’ with Zonderling, an energetic combination coming from these two artists great creative arsenals.  
 
A sunshine-ready track to warm up the winter months with a new twist on Lost Frequencies’ adored house sound, ‘Crazy’ is individualistic and captivating with a sing-a-long chorus that enchanted at its debut live Tomorrowland debut. With lyrics including “I don’t care what the world says” and asking “so what if I am crazy?”, that wrap around bouncing synth lines, ‘Crazy’ is a future classic that is sure to stand the test of time amongst some of Lost Frequencies biggest back catalogue hits, and the perfect anthem to inaugurate the Found Frequencies venture.

Want to see how to water your plants on vacation with the Google Assistant? Check out this link: https://youtu.be/VzJgXHVvur8

Here's what went down in our “Hey Google, pamper my plants” routine:
Google Home Mini plays jungle paradise sounds
Grow lights turn on
Turntables with plants rotate
Watering system turns on
Humidifier turns on 
Nest thermostat sets the perfect temperature
Shades open to let in sunlight

Crazy name for a girl with an infectious personality. One of the most cheerful people I've seen but backs it up with an amazing talent. Love the fact that she's ""too hungover to be nervous"" and still performs so well. You can't help but smile. She takes the violin to a new level."

Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station
Winters cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Satellite, headlines read
Someones secrets youve seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Whos the king of your satellite castle?
Winters cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Rest high above the clouds no resrictions
Television we bounce round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about the weathermans satellite eyes.

Lyrics:
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
What you said now you can’t take away
You’re my gospel but I’m losing faith
Losing faith.
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
Take a minute do you need to stop and think
What we have now we can throw away
Throw away
 
Show me that you mean it, eh
Show me that you mean it
Do you really mean it
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it
Do you, do you?
Show me that you mean it
Do you, do you?

I hope you mean what you say, girl
Have you been lying to my face, girl
Said you needed some space, girl
I tried to stay out your way, girl
You heard some stories about my past, eh
So we can leave them in the past, eh
You said it’s hard for you to trust again
I’m wondering if you’re really over it.
 
Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
What you said now you can’t take away
You’re my gospel but I’m losing faith
Losing faith.
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
Take a minute do you need to stop and think
What we have now we can throw away
Throw away
 
Show me that you mean it, eh
Show me that you mean it 
Do you really mean it 
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it
Do You, do you?
Show me that you mean it
Do You, do you?
 
Times up but you’re gonna say next?
Can’t hide what you did to me
Pull you out like a cigarette, put me out of my misery
It’s not you it’s me
Come on seriously
Heard that once or twice before
You got that straight from a movie
 
Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
What you said now you can’t take away
You’re my gospel but I’m losing faith
Losing faith.
 
Do you mean do you mean what you say 
Take a minute do you need to stop and think
What we have now we can throw away
Throw away

Show me that you mean it, eh
Show me that you mean it 
Do you really mean it 
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it
Do You, do you?
Show me that you mean it
Do You, do you?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Verse 2]
I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Bridge]
I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

Note: The video states Mirai Nagasu was the second American to land a triple axel in competition (this was recorded before her Olympic success). In 2005, American Kimmy Miessner completed a triple axel in national competition, though not world competition. You can read about it here: http://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=1967992

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the triple axel and why it's such a big deal. The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.

As a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.

And that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.

Friends portrayed lovers as friends, and friends as the loves of each other's lives. From Rachel and Ross to Monica and Chandler, the great love stories on the show are friendships. When Jennifer Aniston's Rachel gets pregnant, Rachel and Ross become a strong parenting team still as friends. As we open on these six characters in Central Perk -- Joey, Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Ross and Rachel -- they are each other's family, too. The humor and stories on the show underlined the crucial impact of friends in shaping who we are.

So when Matthews shed his backing players to swing by the Tiny Desk for a solo gig, he couldn't just knock out three songs and bail. Instead, he played a set so long — so defiantly un-Tiny — that his between-song banter could have filled a Tiny Desk concert on its own.

After a bit of judicious trimming, we're still left with this warm, winning, utterly game, happily overstuffed performance, which balances songs from Dave Matthews Band's new album Come Tomorrow (""Samurai Cop,"" ""Here on Out"") with older material (1998's ""Don't Drink the Water,"" 2012's ""Mercy"") and a deeper cut from his 2003 solo album (""So Damn Lucky""). And, we had to leave in some of Matthews' banter, which includes a priceless bit in which he enthusiastically illustrates some of the many differences between playing on stage with a band and sitting at an office desk with an acoustic guitar.


SET LIST
""Samurai Cop (Oh Joy Begin)""
""Here on Out""
""Don't Drink the Water""
""Mercy""
""So Damn Lucky""

I decided to be open and share one of my professional failures to show you how I learned to deal with them and grow from it! This is obviously not about Victoria’s secret- it’s about learning how to be confident, kind to yourself and wiser. Sometimes we are our own enemy- as I was in this specific case! We are 100% responsible for our own happiness and progress! 

When I talk about these subjects of self love and learning to embrace yourself and become the best version of yourself- it all comes from different experiences I had both professionally and personally that taught me a thing or two about falling and getting back up.
I hope this story of mine with getting rejected by victoria's secret will teach you a thing or two and hopefully you'll learn that failure depends on how you view life, the lessons you take from it and how you come back after!

Lots of love,
V

From his ubiquitous video game series to his record-breaking feats at The X-games, Tony's influence is writ large on skate culture. So we thought it was only fitting to have one legend in the skate world judge another set of legends in the burger world. And for good measure, Tony busted out some tricks on the vert ramp with—you guessed it—a burger in hand.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Verse 2]
I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Bridge]
I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

Arguably the most important figure in streetwear today, Abloh sat down with us for our DIARIES series to talk more in-depth on the current state of streetwear, comparing it to an art movement where “essentially I’m just an assistant to the people that came before me trying to add to go forward for the next generation.”

The Off-White™ designer and architect says, “more than anything I feel like I’m a descendant of everyone from Kanye West to Pharrell Williams to Basquiat or Warhol,” when asked about he labels himself. In terms of the bigger picture for streetwear, Virgil says he doesn’t want the larger fashion community and ecosystem to view it just as a trend that comes and goes — streetwear as an art movement that inspires other industries hasn’t been realized yet but it has started to show. Most importantly, Abloh says it’s important for him to stay true to himself, wearing Jordans and a T-shirt to the Met Gala and playing Migos at his fashion show.

You can listen to the rest of the interview above and check out the full spread in Issue 20 of HYPEBEAST Magazine. Be sure to keep an eye peeled for our full Virgil Abloh documentary coming soon.

For chefs like Alvin Cailan, many parts of Bob's life resonate with his own experience running a kitchen. Which is why Alvin was so excited to meet the man who voices Bob—H. Jon Benjamin—and cook burgers from the show IRL for the season finale of The Burger Show. If you want to taste burgers made on The Burger Show, check out the last night of Alvin's burger pop-up, March 13th, at the Nolitan Hotel in NYC. 

We're finally here to supply you with the dopest merch! We sell everything from Hot Ones Hot Sauce like the The Last Dab to the highest quality tees. Shop here: https://bit.ly/2w8lVer

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, burger scholar George Motz, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

Enjoy the full game against CD Espanyol.
---
El FC Barcelona ha ganado la III Supercopa de Catalunya, en un partido que se ha resuelto en la tanda de penaltis. El conjunto azulgrana ha anotado todos los lanzamientos desde los 11 metros y Cillessen ha parado el penalti decisivo a Jurado. Es la segunda edición del torneo que se lleva el equipo azulgrana, tras ganar también en los penaltis el año 2016 en Montilivi.

El partido ha comenzado con la oportunidad más clara del Barça en la primera mitad. A los treinta y ocho segundos de juego, Paco Alcácer no ha conseguido culminar una ocasión muy clara de gol. La opción más clara del Espanyol en la primera parte ha llegado en el minuto 39. Piatti ha enviado a las nubes, casi a bocajarro, un rechace de Cillessen. Y en el minuto 42, Denis Suárez, uno de los más activos en la primera parte, ha notado unas molestias y ha tenido que ser sustituido por Christian Rivera, llegando al descanso con el resultado inicial.

Valverde reparte minutos entre los jóvenes
En la segunda parte, ninguno de los dos equipos dominaba el juego y no llegaban las ocasiones de peligro. Sólo un centro de Piatti desde la banda izquierda que se ha envenenado y ha tocado el larguero ha inquietado a Cillessen en los primeros minutos de la reanudación. El técnico vasco ha aprovechado la segunda mitad para dar minutos de juego a los jugadores del banquillo. M.Hongla y Carlos Pérez han debutado con el primer equipo sustituyendo a André Gomes y O.Dembélé, y David Costas también ha disfrutado de minutos en el eje de la defensa.

Llegan las ocasiones
En el minuto 72, el Espanyol ha disfrutado de una buena opción, con un remate de Alex López que Cillessen ha desviado a córner con solvencia. Tres minutos después, Aleix Vidal ha probado a Pau López, que ha parado su disparo desde la frontal del área. El técnico vasco ha hecho debutar también a Abel Ruiz, Miranda y McGuane. En el minuto 77, Paco Alcácer ha vuelto a rozar el gol con un remate de cabeza, pero el portero blanquiazul ha frustrado la diana azulgrana. El delantero de Torrent lo ha vuelto a intentar en el minuto 89 con una falta lejana, pero se ha vuelto a encontrar con el portero rival, llegando a los penaltis, en los que se ha decidido quién sería el campeón.

Acierto absoluto en los penaltis
Los jugadores de Valverde han anotado los cuatro penatis que han lanzado. Alcácer, Palencia, Yerry Mina y Abel Ruiz han batido a Pau López. En el Espanyol, Alex López y Hermoso han anotado sus lanzamientos, pero Darder ha enviado el suyo por encima del larguero. En el penalti decisivo, Cillessen ha adivinado el disparo de Jurado, otorgando el título al FC Barcelona."

""Iteration 1"" by Jesse Lupini

After waking up in a bizarre facility, Anna is forced to work together with her literal past lives in order to escape.

Anna wakes up in a strange white room. She has 60 seconds to escape, and when the timer hits zero she drops dead, only to reawaken in the same room, alongside a shadowy impression of her previous self. Stuck on repeat, Anna must think ahead and learn from her mistakes to solve a series of puzzles and escape this dystopian maze with the help of her past lives.

Nothing says rap better than a good feud! The Evolution Of Diss Tracks. What's beef? Is it when your mom ain't safe up in the street? Or is it actually the fifth element of hip-hop? Dating all of the way back to when Big Bank Hank of the Sugar Hill Gang borrowed Grandmaster Caz's rhyme book and used his lyrics without credit on ""Rapper's Delight,"" MCs have been feuding on and off wax for years. #hiphopuniverse #hiphoprankings

Hip-hop is a culture built around machismo and bravado, so backing down or losing a battle could be detrimental to an artist's career. One slip-up and you could find yourself with a one-way ticket to obscurity. Certain MCs have built entire careers around beefing with other artists, while others have had their careers d*stroyed with just a couple lines. But what once began as two rappers simply battling over skill has turned into big business, with parody music videos, elaborate stage shows and entire albums dedicated to the coveted battle.

The ante is constantly being upped to keep the fans entertained, so lines will be crossed while artists strive to find unique and creative ways to slander their opponents. Mothers, women and children have all been involved, and in the YouTube era, a rapper just might show up to your house with a camera crew looking for a br*wl.

The best hip-hop songs of all time are those songs that touch our soul. They make us smile, laugh, cry, think, move and shake what our mama (or papa) gave us. 

I traveled back four decades and dug through a pile of tunes to compile a list of the greatest songs hip-hop has ever witnessed.

Picking hip-hop's greatest songs is an incredibly difficult (and incredibly fun) undertaking, considering the various styles that have splintered the genre every way imaginable. Now 40 years old, hip-hop no more belongs to Bronx originators than it does to today's kids; its popularity has stretched to all corners, and the various mutations reflect that. Our picks reflect the songs that innovated, enlightened, delighted, and lasted. These are hip-hop tracks that, with any justice, our grandchildren will have on playlists that are implanted into their brains, or whatever.

ABOUT THE FOOD RANGER 

My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can . I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way! Over the next few years, I'm going to travel around the world and document as much food as I can for you! I love delicious food! This channel will show you real Chinese food and real local food, not that stuff they serve in the Buzzfeed challenge.

Monster iSport Freedom V2 On-Ear Headphones Review! So a couple years back I reviewed the original Freedoms and I must say there are some noticeable upgrades on the new version. I think they will have a good chance to make the list for Best Workout Headphones 2018 / Best Sport Headphones 2018. In terms of design and fit, the Monster iSport Freedom 2 wireless headphones have a more refined look and softer ear cups as well as an upgrade to the hinges. Monster also switched up the remote system on the new version - they now have a single button for power and Bluetooth and a touch system for adjusting volume and track management. Another upgrade comes in the sound quality as the new iSport Freedoms have a more crisp, full sound profile than the originals. Lastly, the other major upgrade is battery life - now over 24 hours of playback on single charge. Overall, the Monster iSport Freedom 2s are solid over-ear headphones and might make the list for Best Wireless Headphones 2018 / Best On-Ear Headphones 2018.

SZA - Go Gina (Stripped LIFT)

SZA is enjoying a big blast of acclaim for 'Ctrl,' one of 2017's most inventive albums. Our newest LIFT artist performs ""Go Gina"" accompanied only by a bassist in an outdoor setting, and it almost more fierce than the studio version. See how different this spin is compared to the original.

I think the answer is simply... Love. In this video, I make an argument for the popular ""Reylo"" theory (which has been around since at least the release of TFA), stating my case for why I think the sequel trilogy is a story of the two halves of the Force learning to love each other. 

By the end of Episode IX, the Skywalker saga will need to be a complete story that stands on its own. I can think of no better way to accomplish that than through this romance. 

So as you get ready for The Last Jedi trailer, or take to the internet afterward to find videos speculating about what will happen, I hope this video finds its way to a device near you!

In celebration of that incredible legacy, and the many actresses who've contributed to it, let's see what those Bond girls are up to today.

Ursula Andress helped set the template for Bond girls when she appeared as Honey Ryder in 1962's Dr. No. The scene in which she walks out of the ocean in a bikini is one of the franchise's most memorable entrances. She continued acting regularly through the 1980s, most prominently in 1981's Clash of the Titans. Her acting work slowed in the '90s, and she hasn't made a film since 2005.

An Italian model and beauty queen, Dianela Bianchi's biggest acting role came as Tatiana Romanova in the second Bond film, From Russia With Love. She retired from acting in 1970 to marry Italian businessman Alberto Cameli, though she has since appeared in documentary footage discussing her time as a Bond girl.

For many, Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, a villain who proves Bond's equal and ultimately switches sides for him in Goldfinger, is the quintessential Bond girl. Since that unforgettable role, Blackman has continued working regularly on stage and screen, and she's also enjoyed a singing career. Her most recent acting appearance was in an episode of You, Me & Them in 2015.  Keep watching the video to see what every Bond girl looks like today!

Subscribe to Zedd’s channel to stay up-to-date on all his latest videos.
 
We worked really hard on this record to get it just right and it feels great to be able to finally share it with everyone. It was super fun working with Maren because she is clearly an amazing singer and very talented musician.  And, I always love working with Grey because we push ourselves to make the best music possible and the end result is incredible. - Zedd
 
I met Zedd in Nashville several weeks ago when he came to town to record my vocal for “The Middle”. My fans know that my sounds is reflective of my many influences as a songwriter and artist and I think they’ll be ecstatic to hear this collaboration with him and Grey! - Maren Morris
 
Some songs come really quickly and naturally, but for a while there it seemed like this song didn’t want to come out. We ran into obstacle after obstacle, but we kept fighting for it because we knew this song was special. This is also our first time working with a country singer, and the different styles ended up fitting perfectly! SO glad that we can finally share this one with you, so enjoy! - Grey
 
Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs
 
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware
 
Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen
 
Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken
 
How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
 
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

I can’t guarantee that all of the make-up and skincare products I recommend will suit you. I only use products I personally think are good having tried them on myself and my clients but everyone's skin is different and it's possible to be allergic to anything. Wherever possible, test products out on yourself before purchasing.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

I do not accept payment and am not sponsored to make any of the films on this channel. Some of the links under the videos and blog posts on my site are affiliated however and as stated before, I only feature products I like, or want to try.

They’ve been at the heart of a debate that goes back more than five decades. Lines have been drawn so intractable that friendships, relationships, even nations have been ruined. Who could forget the Great Twix Battle between the UK and Finland in 1984? No, we’re not speaking of the Left vs. Right debate. We’re talking about the Conflict of Classification that rages to this day. The age old debate: is Twix candy or cookie? Out of respect for those who came before, we will not take a position. Instead, join Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make a gourmet version of Twix that can hopefully bring peace to this conflict.

Lyrics: 

I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, What's wrong? This shirt cost $20
I said, Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep
She said, You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet
I said, Mom, let's put these clothes back, please
She said no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show
I said, This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer"

Lyrics: 
Young ambition 
Say we’ll go slow but we never do 
 
Premonition: 
Seeing me spending every night with you
 
Yeah under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite 
And I wanna end up on you
Don’t need no place to go 
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do 
 
We can just dance to this
Don’t take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body 
And you know we’ve,
Already seen all of the parties 
We can just dance to this 
(We can just) We can just dance to this
 
[ARIANA]
Dear beloved 
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer 
And dear my lover 
Do that thing we never do sober, sober 
 
[BOTH]
Under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite 
And I wanna end up on you, yeah
We don’t need no place to go 
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do 
 
We can just dance to this
Don’t take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body 
And you know we’ve,
Already seen all of the parties 
We can just dance to this 
(We can just) We can just dance to this
 
I don’t want to sleep tonight
I just want to take that ride yeah
I don’t want to sleep tonight
I just want to take that ride yeah
 
We can just dance to this
Don’t take much to start me

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, burger scholar George Motz, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

Lyrics

I've been working on myself and on my patience
But sometimes that shit don't come easy
And I see you've been tryin your best to give me explanations
But words don't really cut it lately

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best , yeah
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we're sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together
We don't do no, we don't do no conversations
We don't talk the way we used to
You act like we're all good sometimes, you know I hate it
'Cause it's so obvious it ain't true

Remember when our love was precious
We thought what we had was the best yet
Now every answer's a question
Like every night is one of us is getting agressive
The other one's acting possessive
Guess it's the way that we do shit now

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe we're crazy
No one loves me better
Than you, you, you, you

You and me we never say we sorry
Hands around my body
Fucking 'til we're good, good
Fucking 'til we're good
And we promise we'll do better
Both go down together
Fucking 'til we're good

If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
If it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
So good together"

After making gourmet Doritos, Claire was pretty confident she could make gourmet Takis in just one day, but the length of this video might say otherwise. Anyway, join Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make a gourmet version of Takis.

Rules for the contest: 

1) Make a 1 - 2 min video about 5 things you want to accomplish in the next 5 years.  (Videos longer than 2 minutes will be disqualified, if it’s only over by a few seconds it’s ok. ) (no minimum length required) 
2) Upload your video to youtube on or before September 10th at 10 am PST
3) Title your video ""Hey Alex, It's my 5 things""
4) Follow the twitter handles @itsalexclark / @huiontab ... the winner will be announced on twitter
5) In the description of your video include a link to your twitter profile as well as what country you are from
6) Make sure the video is posted as a PUBLIC video (unlisted or private videos will not be considered)
7)Around October 1st I will announce the winner on twitter
8) ONLY ONE ENTRY PER PERSON - MULTIPLE ENTRIES BY ONE PERSON WILL DISQUALIFY ALL ENTRIES BY SAID PERSON
9) You must be 13 yrs or older to enter. (Under 13 may enter with a parents permission)
10) The contest is open to all countries world wide. 
11)  I am running this contest alone, and I imagine it will be difficult and time consuming to watch all entries so if I get behind schedule or something that is why. No matter what, at the end of the day - one of you will win a drawing display!
12) I may talk about the contest more on my second channel youtube.com/alexclarklive - subscribe to that if you want insider info. 
13) Again, I am running this contest alone, so if there seems to be rules or questions people have in the comments that come up a lot - I will add them to the rules here.  
14) DO NOT email / dm or attempt to submit your video in some form other than youtube upload. 
15) The lucky winner will receive a Kamvas 22 Pro drawing display.  It runs on either windows or mac but it does require a separate computer to operate.  Here is a link to it: https://www.huiontablet.com/kamvas-gt-221-pro-v2.html
16) Your video can be live action, animated, stop motion, it can be anything... put effort in to make it unique - spend a long time making a great video
17) Good luck!

GOOD LUCK! I can’t wait to see how talented you all are and I am positive something epic will win.

P.S. Please don’t DM or email submissions - this does not help at all - and will disqualify you.

Most of us have moments that we would rather keep private. And many of us can afford to take our secrets to the grave. But then again, we’re not part of the Kardashian/Jenner clan. There’s no point in denying the power and the influence of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. They’ve given us a ton of makeup tips, showed us how to get over horrible breakups, and so much more. But people forget that Kim, Kris, Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie, Caitlyn, and the rest of the family are human. They want their privacy too. But it doesn’t mean they’ll be able to get it. Their lives are dissected piece by piece, and they’re in on it for the long run. After all, the show was their idea, wasn’t it? Do you think that the benefits of being a reality star outweigh the drawbacks? Let us know in the comment section and then click subscribe to get more videos from TheTalko.

Espai Barça will be integrated harmoniously within Barcelona’s Les Corts neighborhood and will include the construction of the New Camp Nou, which will hold around 105,000 spectators, maintaining its reign as the largest stadium in Europe. A new Palau Blaugrana (arena) for 12,500 spectators will be built on the site of the current Mini Estadi.
 
The scope of the proposal also includes moving the Mini Estadi to the Estadi Johan Cruyff, near FC Barcelona’s Sports Center in Sant Joan Despí. The development of club activities where the current Palau Blaugrana is located, including offices, FCBotiga and dining options, will see the creation of open areas and public pathways that will better integrate club activities with the surrounding community as well as improve accessibility and parking.
 
The project, which is expected to be completed by the 2023-2024 season, will be an example of the best practices in energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.

The Millennium Falcon is just about the coolest spaceship in sci-fi history. And it's also an uncomfortable, unreliable, ugly hunk of junk. Sure, it might feel tempting to hop aboard and live out your days as a devilish rogue or a heroic starfighter, but you're probably better off keeping your feet on the ground. Here's a look at why it would pretty much suck to live on the Millennium Falcon...

White Bird in a Blizzard Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Shailene Woodley, Eva Green Movie HD

Kat Connors (Shailene Woodley) is 17 years old when her perfect homemaker mother, Eve (Eva Green), a beautiful, enigmatic, and haunted woman, disappears - just as Kat is discovering and relishing her newfound sexuality. Having lived for so long in a stifled, emotionally repressed household, she barely registers her mother's absence and certainly doesn't blame her doormat of a father, Brock, (Christopher Meloni) for the loss. In fact, it's almost a relief. But as time passes, Kat begins to come to grips with how deeply Eve's disappearance has affected her. Returning home on a break from college, she finds herself confronted with the truth about her mother's departure, and her own denial about the events surrounding it...

I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, a nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!

His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke."""

Description:
Super Bowl 52 (LII) was amazing! 

Here is a list of the best Super Bowl Commercials of 12018! The New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles faced off in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 4th, 2018. Kickoff was at 6:30PM EST, and aired on NBC. Everyone was looking forward to seeing if Tom Brady could win his 6th Super Bowl, or Nick Foles could lead the Eagles to their first Super Bowl win, theres also plenty of commercials that were showcased. That, and Justin Timberlake being featured at halftime. It was an amazing game and Eagles deserve a parade for the ages in Philadephia! 

All  I care about is the big game, crazy super bowl food recipes and COMMERCIALS!Some of these Super Bowl Commercials are Hilarious. Some of these Super Bowl Commercials Will Make You Cry. Superstars like Morgan Freeman, Danny Devito, and Keanu Reeves will make appearances in Super Bowl 52 Commercials. Pringles, Skittles, M&M, Budweiser, SquareSpace, and Pepsi are just a few of the companies that will be spending millions of dollars on super bowl commercials. 

How much does a Super Bowl commercial cost? Over 4 million dollars! These companies better make their 30 seconds worth it! Over one billion people will be watching! How much do super bowl commercial actors make? Well, if they're not famous, they still make enough money to be able to not have to work for the rest of the year! Sit back, relax, and enjoy THE BEST Super Bowl 52 (Super Bowl LII) Commercials. 

Super Bowl 52 Commercials on this list: 

Tide Super Bowl Commercial
Kia Steven Tyler Aerosmith Super Bowl Commercial
NFL Odell and Eli Super Bowl Commercial

I’m often asked by my more mature viewers, ‘What makeup can I wear for an evening or party?’ or ‘ I like wearing bright lip colour but I’m in my 60s and I don’t think it’s appropriate’. So, this film is an evening party look with a beautiful bold lip.

Here I demonstrate techniques on Dalia on how to achieve a modern, lasting evening look and show you that no matter what your age you can rock bright lipstick. Whether you are in this category or you’d like to help your mother or grandmother do her makeup, I hope you like it. X 

For alternative dupes for the limited edition lipstick, Revon's Super Lustrous Lipstick in 440 Cherries in the Snow http://lisae.me.uk/16267-27043 and Rimmel's Colour Rush Balm in All you need is pink http://lisae.me.uk/27076-27043 are great.

M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. “After more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,” Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, “My life’s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.” Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: ‘The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M’s are the best M&M’s.’ A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: “And now we begin our studies into why blue M&M’s are definitely the next best M&M’s!”

Toyota is returning to the 2018 Super Bowl like never before using sports to unite and inspire during three ads in the most-watched television event of the year. The final spot to be released is from the domestic U.S., longtime campaign “Let’s Go Places,” empowering viewers to see what they’re capable of when fans unite through sports. For the first time in the company’s history, Toyota will have three primetime commercials which will be airing in the first quarter, halftime and second half.  
 
Prior to the halftime show and following the Toyota Halftime Report and a throw from NBC Sports anchor Dan Patrick, Toyota’s 60-second ad, “One Team,” features an amusing, light-hearted narrative illustrating how people from diverse backgrounds unite to celebrate the spirit of what brings them together, their shared passion of sports. 
 
“This is an unprecedented opportunity for our team at Toyota to share messages of unity, friendship, diversity and perseverance,” says Ed Laukes, group vice president, Toyota Marketing, Toyota Motor North America. “With the Super Bowl and the Olympics just days apart on NBC, we’re excited to join fans’ enthusiasm for these two world-class events and connect with them by sharing meaningful and inspiring TV spots.”
 
View the 60-second “One Team.” Previously released were Toyota’s 60-second “Good Odds” which celebrates the automaker’s evolution to a mobility company and its eight-year global sponsorship of The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games; and the 30-second spot “Mobility Anthem” highlighting Toyota’s belief that when you are free to move, anything is possible. To view, visit YouTube.com/Toyota. 
 
The “Lets Go Places” TV spot “One Team” was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and directed by veteran filmmaker Ivan Zacharias. The “Start Your Impossible” TV commercials were developed by Toyota’s agencies of record, Saatchi & Saatchi and Dentsu, with “Good Odds” directed by esteemed director Aoife McArdle and “Mobility Anthem” directed by acclaimed director John Hillcoat.

Lyrics:

made plans with me and all your friends
i’m late again, i hate to keep you waiting
tried to be a gentleman
got drunk again, before i even made it
tried to call a car for you
you’re tired of me, i knew you wouldn’t take it
you walked a mile in louis vuittons
and fucked em up, you know that they’re my favorite
 
but we dress up and play pretend
then we act like we’re good again
i do things i can’t defend
and even when you hold it in
 
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
explosions, hidden when we’re in the open
keep on smiling, until it’s over
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
 
arguments that never end
you’re talkin shit, to spice up conversation
i’m so sick of back and forth
these fights with you are starting to feel contagious
said that i’m no good for you
right before we walked into your parents
then you put on that smile again
and grabbed my hand, even though you hate it
 
but we dress up and play pretend
then we act like we’re good again
i do things i can’t defend
and even when you hold it in
 
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
explosions, hidden when we’re in the open
keep on smiling, until it’s over
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
 
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t
 
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
explosions, hidden when we’re in the open
keep on smiling, until it’s over
hold it, even though it kills you slowly
 
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t
oh but, but it it, won’t but, i said
you hold on, hopin it gon stop, but it don’t

Barça rolled to a 5-1 win over their arch-rivals with style!

The victory keeps Barça in first place in La Liga and it all went down in a raucous Camp Nou. Goal after goal after goal was met with thundering approval from the blaugrana faithful. And when it was over, the players had the chance to celebrate with their families on the grass before speaking to the media. See these amazong images of it all in today's El Clásico Inside View.

FROM THE MIND OF WILL.I.AM COMES A FUTURISTIC B-BOY ZOMBIE THRILLER, FUSING TOGETHER THE UNLIKELIEST OF GENRES WITH EASE! Masters Of the Sun mixes L.A. Gang culture, B-Boy-ism and Egyptology to tell the heroic tale of a Hip-Hop group from East L.A. who must battle an ancient, alien God sent to earth to continue a Black Curse--which turns drug dealers and gangsters into zombies! With a deep love of the Hip-Hop culture, Zulu-X and his crew go head-to-head with a nefarious ancient order that has infiltrated the inner cities to settle an ancient score. What happens next can only be described as the perfect blend of action, ancient wisdom and street-smarts all rolled into one epic adventure. Boasting one of the most eclectic ensemble cast of characters, Masters of the Sun delivers a powerful social allegory in the form of a new movement...#stayWOKE!!!

Bartenders often overlook vodka as a serious cocktail ingredient due to it’s relatively neutral flavour profile but this very flavour profile allows flexibility when mixing. Vodka’s neutral taste allows it to be paired with a wide range of other flavours including sweet, sour, savoury and spicy – to name a few. Vodka is an approachable spirit – meaning drinkers that aren’t overly adventurous, that may not like herbaceous or bold bitter flavours will find vodka an easy and obvious choice when mixing.

I’ve compiled some of the most popular vodka cocktails in my most recent upload, 5 Quick and Easy Vodka Cocktails. Check it out or  skip to each relevant cocktail below:

0:26 Appletini
2:35 Cosmopolitan
4:05 Caipiroska
6:08 White Russian
7:23 Sea Breeze

VIEW PRINTABLE RECIPES: https://stevethebartender.com.au/5-quick-and-easy-vodka-cocktails/

INGREDIENTS
Vodka (https://drizly.sjv.io/A1P1a)
Cloud Apple Juice, Lemon Juice, Maple Syrup
Cranberry Juice, Cointreau/Triple Sec, Lime Juice
Lime, Brown Sugar
Coffee Liqueur, Milk/Cream
Cranberry Juice, Grapefruit Juice

Music by Julian Avila - Butterfly Effect: https://soundcloud.com/julian_avila/butterfly-effect

HOW TO MAKE AN APPLETINI WITH MAPLE SYRUP
There are numerous variations on the Appletini recipe such as our previously shared Appletini recipe which makes for a citrusy, zesty Appletini. This version of the Appletini utilises cloudy apple juice that has a crisp and wholesome apple flavour which is also full of antioxidants unlike clear apple juice. The apple flavour works hand in hand with the rich tasting maple syrup.

INGREDIENTS
- 45mL Vodka (1½ oz)
- 45mL Cloudy Apple Juice (1½ oz)
- 5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (⅙ oz)
- 5mL Maple Syrup (⅙ oz)

HOW TO MAKE A COSMOPOLITAN
Made infamous from the TV series Sex in the City but this cocktail has been around long before, dating back to the 70s. It is quite similar to a Cranberry Cooler with the addition of Cointreau and served neat instead of tall on ice. It also bears a close resemblance to a Kamikaze cocktail.

INGREDIENTS
- 45mL Vodka (1½ oz)
- 15mL Cointreau (½ oz)
- 45mL Cranberry Juice (1½ oz)
- 10mL Fresh Lime Juice (⅓ oz)

HOW TO MAKE A CAIPIROSKA
Make sure you use plenty of ice, the right dilution makes this cocktail a winner!

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL Vodka (2 oz)
- ¾ to 1 Lime
- 2-3 Teaspoons of Sugar

HOW TO MAKE A WHITE RUSSIAN

INGREDIENTS
- 45mL Vodka (1½ oz)
- 30mL Kahlua (1 oz)
- Dash of Milk (or Cream)

HOW TO MAKE A SEA BREEZE
The Sea Breeze cocktail is a simple, vodka mixed drink. A good measure of vodka is mixed with tart cranberry juice and subtly bitter fresh grapefruit juice. Shake and strain over fresh ice or if you're in a rush, simply build it within your collins glass.
A slightly tart yet refreshing vodka cocktail for summer sipping!

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL Vodka (2 oz)
- 90mL Cranberry Juice (3 oz)
- 60mL Grapefruit Juice (2 oz)"

The best way to look at this device is as a smaller version of the Echo Show. the small rounded screen delivers much of the same information as the larger and more expensive Show. Like the show the functionality is limited to just Alexa commands, apps are not available for it.

All in it's a decent device for those invested in the Amazon eco system.

Which hilarious prank was your favorite? The office scare pranks? The fake snakes/rats scare prank? If you ask me... I love the scary movie mask videos!! But my all-time favorite clip was the boy who hid in the garbage bag and popped out right as his grandma was taking out the trash... her reaction is PRICELESS!

His new methods are driving new norms and new apps for how people quit smoking and decrease obesity, saving many people from an early death.

Jonathan Bricker is an internationally recognized scientific leader in a bold approach called acceptance and commitment therapy. A Stanford researcher called his use of the approach “a breakthrough in behavioral research [that] has major public health implications for the major causes of preventable death.” Bricker and his team, having received $10 million in total federal research grants to study this topic, are rigorously testing this intervention on multiple platforms, including smartphone apps, websites, and telephone coaching. His SmartQuit app for quitting smoking was recently launched and is now in distribution worldwide.

They’re digging for gold in my neighborhood
Where all the old buildings stood
And they keep digging down, down
So that their cars can live underground
The swinging of a wrecking ball 
Through these lath and plaster walls
Is letting all the shadows free 
The ones I wished still followed me

Change, please don’t change
Stay, stay the same

I remember a winter’s night
When we kissed beneath the street lamp light
Outside our bar near the record store
That have been condos for a year or more
And now that our haunts have taken flight
And been replaced with construction sites
Oh how I feel like a stranger here
Searching for something that’s disappeared

They’re digging for gold in my neighborhood
For what they say is the greater good
But all I see is a long goodbye
A requiem for a skyline
It seems I never stop losing you
As every dive becomes something new
And all our ghosts get swept away
It didn’t used to be this way

Change, please don’t change
Stay, stay the same
Cranes devour the light
Strange appetites

I’ve ascribed these monuments
A false sense of permanence
I’ve placed faith in geography
To hold you in my memory
I’m sifting through these wreckage piles
Through the rubble of bricks and wires
Looking for something I’ll never find

They’re digging for gold in my neighborhood
Where all the old buildings stood
And they keep digging down, down
So that their cars can live underground 
It seems I never stop losing you
As every dive becomes something new
And all our ghosts get swept away
It didn’t used to be this way

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?


[Pre Chorus: Alessia Cara + Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

[Bridge: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

[Outro: Alessia Cara]
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

The song incorporates smooth jazz and hip-hop beats while the lyrics address critical social and economic issues, two musical elements that are reminiscent of the group’s earlier days.

YouTube royalty, and his eponymous show is a paradigm-shifting mix of news and opinion tackling everything from politics, to celebrity gossip, to the crypto-currency boom. But what does a decade-plus on the platform mean if he can't handle his spicy wings?! By popular demand (i.e., an insane amount of comments demanding his presence at the table), Philly D finally steps into the Hot Ones terror dome to go head to head with our bald protagonist, Sean Evans. As they fend off the Scoville onslaught, the duo gets into the weeds of YouTube history, unpackages the problems with contemporary media, and reveals photographic evidence of a bygone era when Sean actually had a six pack. And that's not all—with the weight of YouTube on his back, DeFranco boldly sets out to go where no guest has gone before. Don't miss this piece of Hot Ones history.

The first test is Genoise cake, an Italian sponge cake. For the creamy filling, Claire uses 7 minute frosting. The second test is yellow cake and buttercream filling. Next comes chiffon cake, a light cake that uses vegetable oil. Finally, with some help from Test Kitchen Manager Brad Leone, Claire decides to ""Frankenstein"" the recipe.

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

In episode 2, Miss Info investigates how the Jamaican beef patty became a NYC icon. As the flaky meat turnover has infiltrated all aspects of city life—found in mom-and-pop bakeries, bodegas, pizza shops, and even street carts—the patty itself has inspired fierce debate. Because if you think a patty is a patty is a patty...well, you're dead wrong. From heated conversations with DJ Clark Kent, to philosophical musings in the back of a Rolls Royce with Upscale Vandal, here are what New Yorkers really have to say about the beef patty.

Full Video Transcript Here:
http://www.actualized.org/articles/bad-habits

Video Summary:
We all have bad habits, whose effects can vary from mild to costly and dangerous. Once the rut of a bad habit is worn in your mind, it can take a lot of momentum to propel yourself out of it. 

The first step to breaking a bad habit is to consider your motivation for wanting to change. External pressure to please or not disappoint others creates much weaker motivation than calculating a cost -- benefit analysis that convinces you to do it for your own good. The second step is to accept responsibility for your habit. You can't break a habit if you blame someone else for making you do it. And believe that you indeed can make the change. If you think you can't, you won't. 

Then make a 100% commitment with no wiggle room. Use the Law of Attraction to replace your bad habit with a positive one. To further strengthen your resolve, employ the technique of visualization via future projection -- of both the mental, physical, and financial cost of continuing the habit, as well as the improvement in all those areas of your life when you substitute a positive habit in its place.

Again and Again
Mama save me save me
Mama bless me to my bones
You have start the fire
Reignite my soul
With your poison sting
Is deep and true
I’d do anything
Your sweet perfume
You bleed
‘Til the well is overflow
You’re my gold, my hunger
Where you go I will follow
Sweet poison sting
I see the light
I see everything
In you tonight
I breathe
In and out here we go
Over and again and again
And the love you give to me
Mama I’m gonna
Give it back to you
All the stars
In the sky
So beautiful
In your eyes
Shine, shine
Reachin’ out
Reachin’ out for you
Just to kiss your mouth
Wanna turn you inside out
Is there such a thing as you do to me
Sweet poison sting lets me see
I’ll be your king
‘Cause you are my queen
In and out here we go
Over and again and again
All of the love
You give to me
Mama I’m gonna give it back to you
Don’t let it get away
And if we did
We’re gonna get it back
And in time you and me
We will, we will, we will, we will be
Over and again and again
And the love you give to me
Mama I’m gonna give it back to you
Turn around here we go
Over and again and again
All of the love you give to me
Mama gonna give it back to you
And the love
I’m gonna give it back to you
And the love
Mama I’m gonna give it back to you

Lyrics:

Can’t help but wondering 
if this is the last time that I’ll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain (‘POURING’ CLEAN)
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn’t sound insane
But lately I don’t trust my brain
You told me I won’t ever change
So I just say nothing
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back
I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
Cos you know every morning I wake up
Yeah I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I’ve moved on 
Yeah I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back, want you back
You know even when I say I’ve moved on
You know even though I know that you’re gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I’ve moved on
You know even though I know that you’re gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
No matter how long you’re gone, I’m always gonna want you back
I know that you know, I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back
I’m always gonna want you back
Want you back

It also ignited a rivalry that would go on until 2003. In that span, the teams combined for 5 Stanley Cups, 2 major brawls, countless other fights, and so many penalties. Highlights include multiple goalie vs. goalie fights, coaches screaming at coaches, blood, hits, revenge, and really good hockey.

I compiled a list of 25+ of the most popular gin cocktails and asked for everyone's input -  to vote for their personal favourite GIN Cocktail. There were over 250 respondents to the survey resulting in the Best Gin Cocktails list! Given the number of responses received, I decided to create a mini-series for The Best Gin Cocktails. This is Vol. 1.

INGREDIENTS LIST FOR ALL 7 GIN COCKTAILS:
- Gin (London Dry, Old Tom)
- Maraschino Liqueur
- Creme de Violette
- Creme de Mure
- Champagne / Sparkling Wine
- Lemon Juice
- Simple Syrup (1:1)
- Soda / Seltzer
- Basil
- Raspberry Syrup
- Egg White

Here are the top 7 gin cocktails based on these votes.

---AVIATION---
The most searched cocktail on the internet back in 2013. The Aviation has been printed in numerous cocktail books – many of which excluded the Creme de Violette, as this liqueur was largely unavailable in the states until recent years.

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL London Dry Gin (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 15mL Maraschino Liqueur (½ oz)
- 1 Barspoon Crème de Violette

---TOM COLLINS---
The Tom Collins would be one of the most well known of the Collins’, made using a sweeter style, Old Tom gin. The collins cocktail is a great base to create variations by adding complimentary components and flavours such as elderflower, lychee and other fruit flavours in the form of fresh fruit, syrups and liqueurs. Some collins’ recipes call for a dash or two of bitters but I usually omit this.

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL Old Tom Gin (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 15mL Simple Syrup (1:1) (½ oz)
- Soda

---BASIL SMASH---
In the mid 2000s a German bartender create the Basil Smash – a herbaceous gin sour recipe.

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL Gin (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 22.5mL Simple Syrup (1:1) (¾ oz)
- 2-3 Sprigs of Fresh Basil

---BRAMBLE---
In 1984, London Bartender, Dick bradsell tweaked a classic gin sour by adding Creme de Mure (blackberry liqueur). Use crushed ice so that the Creme de Mure cascades down making a nice visual effect whilst adding a great balance of sweet, tart and fruitiness. Feel free to tweak this by adding a jam whether it be blackberry, raspberry, strawberry or what ever you have on hand.

INGREDIENTS
- 45mL Gin (1½ oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 15mL Simple Syrup (½ oz)
- 22.5mL  Crème de Mure (¾ oz)

---CLOVER CLUB---
A pre-prohibition cocktail that was named after a Philadelphia men’s group consisting of business professionals. First published in 1901 in the New York Press. It fell out of fashion by the 1950s and became more of a ladies drink. Traditionally served with no garnish but you can utilise a lemon twist or skewered raspberry if you like. This particular recipe was published in Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s The Bar Book.

The Clover Club bar in NY have created a popular variation with the addition of 15mL of Dry Vermouth.

INGREDIENTS
- 45mL Gin (1½ oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 22.5mL Raspberry Syrup (¾ oz)
- Fresh Egg White (half a small egg)

---GIN FIZZ---
A fizz is a sour lengthened with soda water. It differs from a collins as it’s shaken and has the addition of egg white – you can omit this if you prefer not use egg in your drinks.

INGREDIENTS
- 60mL Gin (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 22.5mL Simple Syrup (¾ oz)
- Fresh Egg White (half a small egg)
- Soda Water

---FRENCH 75---
The original version of the French 75 calls for cognac – but gin is the more common choice nowadays. It has a similar framework to a collins with the substitution of champagne or sparkling wine instead of soda.

INGREDIENTS
- 30mL Gin (1 oz)
- 30mL Simple Syrup (1:1) (1 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lemon Juice (¾ oz)
- 90mL Champagne or other sparkling wine (3 oz)

About Eminem

Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), better known by his stage name Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM) and by his alter ego Slim Shady, is an American rapper, record producer, songwriter and actor. Eminem along with his solo career is a member of his group D12, and also one half of the hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil, with Royce da 5’9?. Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in the world and is the best selling artist of the 2000s. He has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone magazine which ranked him 82nd on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The same magazine declared him The King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has achieved ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 42 million tracks and 49.1 million albums in the United States, and 100 million albums worldwide.
As an underground rapper Eminem released his debut solo album, Infinite in 1996. He gained mainstream popularity in 1999 after the release of his major-label debut album The Slim Shady LP. The LP also earned Eminem his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two records The Marshall Mathers LP, and The Eminem Show, also won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win Best Rap Album for three consecutive LPs. This was followed by another studio release in 2004 titled Encore. Eminem then went on hiatus after touring in 2005. He released his first album in five years titled Relapse, on May 15, 2009. In 2010, Eminem released his seventh studio album Recovery. Recovery was an international success and was named the best selling album of 2010 worldwide, joining The Eminem Show, which was the best seller of 2002. Eminem won Grammy Awards for both Relapse and Recovery, giving him a total of 13 Grammys in his career.
Eminem has opened other ventures, including his own record label Shady Records with his manager Paul Rosenberg. He also has his own radio channel, Shade 45 on Sirius XM Radio. Eminem began an acting career in 2002, when he starred in the hip hop drama film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, becoming the first rap artist ever to win the award."

In this episode Lee, Denise, and Tina overview the signs supporting the idea that Rey and Kylo Ren will have a romantic arc in the upcoming episodes and how this romance fits in the Star Wars tradition. 

We compare Rey and Kylo Ren to other canon couples in Star Wars films, and discuss the popular ""Reverse Anidala"" theory. We also discuss fairy tale elements present in the dynamics between Rey and Kylo Ren. Lastly, we make predictions and share our own wish list for Reylo in the Sequel Trilogy, including the likelihood of a Rey and Kylo kiss in The Last Jedi.

This is part 2 of our Reylo 101 series.

LYRICS:
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days
These days
These days, these days
These days, these days
 
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
To these days, these days
 
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark
 
I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days"

Welcome to New Haven, a city that has some of the best pizza around. Frank Pinello, our host, has never been to New Haven and the best way to learn about the city is by eating. Frank hangs out with Gary Bimonte, co-owner of legendary pizzeria Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, spends time with the owners of Zuppardi's, and meets some true new haven legends.

Find out as Sean Evans gets schooled by Hard Times Sundaes proprietor Andrew Zurica, a patty purist who flips the ""put an egg on it"" craze on its head: Instead of putting a fried egg on his burgers, he throws a griddled patty inside an NYC-style bacon, egg, and cheese. Learn how to make it on the latest episode of Sean in the Wild.

Lyrics:

Woke up on the west side
Listening to beach house taking my time
She’s just my type
Dark hair waving out the passenger side
 
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing yeah yeah
 
Darling of mine 
Where have you been
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
 
Oh darling of mine
Please don’t let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
 
Oh darling of mine 
Oh darling of mine 
 
On a train through japan I keep her real close cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past and 
It’s that type of thing 
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing yeah yeah
 
Oh darling of mine 
Where have you been
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
 
Oh darling of mine
Please don’t let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
 
Oh darling of mine 
Oh darling of mine 
 
Where have you been
Where have you been
Where have you been
Where have you been
 
Then I start to think 
As I lift her on the sink
That I’ve seen here before
 
It’s a certain type of fling
She gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
 
I just wanna taste
As she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
 
She’s taking what she wants
Baby you can have it all
 
Oh darling of mine 
Where have you been
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
 
Oh darling of mine
Please don’t let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
 
Oh darling of mine 
 
Where have you been
Where have you been
Where have you been
Where have you been
 
Oh darling of mine

In this episode I endeavor to show you guys some really amazing craft applications for Jägermeister in cocktails. Jäger is a great quality product so it makes sense that it has been being used by some of the top bartenders and finding it's way into some of the top bar programs in the country. There really is no reason why Jäger shouldn't be regarded in the same way as Ciociaro, Cynar, Fernet and other top Amari brands. This is a long video but it's well worth it, I cover six great cocktails with really varied flavor profiles that  I think you guys will enjoy. So whether or not you love Jäger, I promise you these drinks will not disappoint!

Originally released just two days prior to Blonde as a visual album, Endless is an absolute fucking experience of an album. It is even more unlike anything I've heard than Blonde is, and easily his best album in terms of vibe (imo.)
This remastered version of Endless was put on his blonded.co site for Cyber Monday in 2017. It was sold in the form of a vinyl record, a CD + a DVD, and a VHS tape, along with two accompanying posters. All of them have this really cool holographic look to them.
The vinyl and CD +  DVD got delayed by a couple months but they eventually got here in early 2018.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Yo, if you want a cool community of people that like Frank Ocean and a bunch of other artists like him, check out this discord server: 
https://discord.me/futura
Discord is basically a modern chatroom with text and voice chat capabilities. There are a lot of different channels in a server for a lot of different interests that you may have (futura has a channel for music, venting, photography, production, and more as of the time that I'm writing this.) It can be kinda confusing to use at first, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
Futura is unique in that is has a monthly radio show that a member from the server makes, and we all get together to listen to it at the end of the month. They usually have really crazy transitions and stuff.
I'm no longer in the server, but the last time I linked it in my descriptions, a lot of people joined and found that the place fit them really well, so I figured I'd start that up again.
If I ever end up back in there, I'll be using the name @Marlow, so if you wanna hang out and i'm there, you know who to @.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I hold no rights or copyrights over this music. This is not my music, and I intend to make no money or profit off of this. I simply posted it here as an archive for other people to enjoy so that they can experience this beautiful album. Copyrights go to Frank Ocean and BOYS DON'T CRY. If anyone from Frank Ocean's team want me to take this down, just contact me and I'll get it down quick.

Please support the official release and spread the word. I'm unaware of where you can purchase this particular version of Endless at this moment, but I do know you can get the original video version on Apple Music still."

I only feature products I like, or want to try. The products I use in these videos are either purchased by me or sent to me by make-up companies to use in my professional capacity as a make-up artist for fashion and celebrity photo shoots, red carpet etc. I am also sent products by many of the top magazines to judge for awards.

Have you noticed that the world depicted in commercials is quite different from the one we actually live in? The people are more beautiful, the food looks delicious, the sun shines brighter, the sand looks softer and even the water seems more... wet. Well, believe me, you are not the only one who noted that.
It’s not a question of different perception, it’s all about the way the commercials are created. This is the real art with its own tricks. In today's video, we will show you what happens behind the scenes on the set of the most impressive commercials."

Music by DJ Quads: https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads/every-morning

ESPRESSO MARTINI COCKTAIL
The espresso martini has been made hugely popular in recent years due to the addictive combination of coffee & vodka! Make sure you use cold drip coffee - coffee extracted with heat tends to go bitter when not used immediately. Cold drip makes a delicious and consistent Espresso Martini - every time!

- 30mL Coffee Liqueur (1 oz)
- 30mL Vodka (1 oz)
- 30mL Coffee (1 oz)

NEGRONI COCKTAIL
This cocktail resembles the Americano (minus the soda and replaced with gin). Not to everyone's taste though I must admit - try easing into one by replacing the Campari with a less bitter Italian aperitif, Aperol - yum!

- 30mL Gin (1 oz)
- 30mL Sweet Vermouth (1 oz)
- 30mL Campari (1 oz)

APEROL SPRITZ COCKTAIL
The Aperol Spritz is a popular summer drink! Aperol's grapefruit notes and subtle bitterness compliment the bubbly, sweeter style prosecco.

- 90mL Prosecco (3 oz)
- 60mL Aperol (2 oz)
- 30mL Soda Water (1 oz)

BROWN DERBY COCKTAIL
The Brown Derby is somewhat of a bourbon whiskey based riff on a classic daiquiri. A big measure of bourbon is balanced with sweet honey syrup and sour and subtly bitter grapefruit juice. Named after the popular LA restaurant from the mid-20th century.

- 60mL Bourbon Whiskey (2 oz)
- 30mL Fresh Grapefruit Juice (1 oz)
- 15mL Honey Syrup (1:1) (½ oz)

BEES KNEES COCKTAIL
The Bee's Knees cocktail recipe was invented out of necessity, hiding the poor quality homemade, bathtub cut gin that was prevalent during the prohibition-era. Nowadays, good quality gin is in abundance and this is a delicious, citrusy and honeyed gin cocktail.

- 60mL Gin (2 oz)
- 15mL Fresh Lemon Juice (½ oz)
- 15mL Honey Syrup (1:1) (½ oz)

MARGARITA COCKTAIL
Tequila and especially margaritas are party drinks, so instead of serving them up in a stemmed Margarita glass, serve them up short on ice by following this simple simple 3-2-1 recipe.

- 45mL Tequila (1½ oz)
- 15mL Triple Sec (½ oz)
- 30mL Fresh Lime Juice(1 oz)

DAIQUIRI COCKTAIL
The Daiquiri would have to be one of the most iconic classics. It was first created in the 1890's and Bacardi was first call. Originally the drink was served in a tall glass packed with ice.

- 60mL White Rum (2 oz)
- 22.5mL Fresh Lime Juice (¾ oz)
- 22.5mL Sugar Syrup (¾ oz)

GODFATHER COCKTAIL
The original recipe of the Godfather calls for equal parts of Scotch Whisky and Amaretto which is quite sweet. I prefer to increase the Scotch Whisky to 45mL and drop the Amaretto to 15mL creating a less sweet and dryer Godfather recipe. Either way, the Amaretto will smooth and sweeten the whisky into a velvety smooth and tasty stirred drink.

- 45mL Scotch Whisky (1½ oz)
- 15mL Amaretto (½ oz)

MANHATTAN COCKTAIL
- 60mL Rye whisky (2 oz)
- 30mL Sweet Red Vermouth (1 oz)
- 2-3 Dashes of Bitters

BRANDY FLIP COCKTAIL
The Brandy Flip is a simple, 3-ingredient cocktail with a rich flavour and creamy texture. The very first Flips emerged as early as the late 1600s - they were originally created with a mixture of sugar, eggs and spices being added to a tankard of ale before being heated with a red-hot iron poker from the fire. Now, a Flip commonly refers to a cocktail of fortified wine or spirit and whole egg sweetened with sugar.

- 60mL Brandy (2 oz)
- 30mL Simple Syrup (1:1) (1 oz)
- Whole Egg"

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. Will this be on iTunes?

--No, not the iTunes store, but it can be in your iTunes for free. Download it from my website, djearworm.com. You don't need to pay the iTunes store to put free mp3s in your iTunes software, you just download the mp3 and then double-click on it (or drag it into your iTunes if that doesn't work).

2. Why is that artist I hate in your list, and why isn't that artist I love in your list?

--This is based on the Top 25 songs of Billboard's 2009 year-end list. I didn't choose the songs. The complete list is here: http://www.billboard.com/charts-year-end#/charts-year-end/hot-100-songs?year=2009

3. Why is that song from last year in the list? Why isn't that song which was so popular toward the end of the year on the list?

--Billboard's cutoff date is Dec 1st, to give them time to calculate the results and publish them well before New Years Day, which is good for me, since I need a little time to put this together and release it before the end of the year!

4. How long did this take you?

--If you add it up, about a month.  About two weeks earlier in the year using educated guesswork, and then two weeks between when Billboard released the list and when I put it out.

5. What software did you use? 

--Ableton Live for arranging the music. It's AWESOME, and it's what I use to DJ live with as well. Final Cut Pro for the video.  For acapella extraction, see the next question.

6. How did you get the vocals without the instruments?

--if you search for ""acapella"" with the name of your song, you might find an isolated vocal. In some cases, I use a bit of Adobe Audition (the Center Channel Extractor effect) for vocal isolation. This removes instruments that are to the left or right in your stereo, and leaves only the sound that's in the center. You can also use this effect to take an instrumental and a full track to create an acapella. Check out my book ""Audio Mashup Construction Kit"" for more details on this technique, there's a whole chapter on it. In a few instances I used Melodyne Studio for vocal isolation.

7. What are the lyrics? Who sang that one part? I didn't hear that one artist!

--I've posted the complete lyrics here, as well as a guide to where each of the lyrics and instruments came from:
http://djearworm.com/united-state-of-pop-2009-blame-it-on-the-pop-lyrics.htm

8. I want to make mashups, do you have any tips?

--Learn as much music theory as possible! Get ACID or Ableton Live, and learn it well. Make sure you understand key and tempo, so you can sync everything and get the parts to harmonize correctly. If you're of a technical mindset, my book ""Audio Mashup Construction Kit"" covers my techniques in great detail.

9. Can I repost this video?

--please, no, and thanks for asking! Use the music however you want, but don't simply repost the video in its entirety on your channel. I lots of people are doing it, but I wish they wouldn't!

10. Doesn't this prove how much pop music sucks nowadays and is basically interchangeable?

--Not at all. If you alter the tempo and pitch of any music enough, you could get anything to fit together, whether it's Bach or the Black Eyed Peas. What it does prove is how far technology has come to make these alterations sound convincing. I've manipulated some of these vocals HEAVILY."

“Pink Lemonade” Lyrics:
Don’t fall into my arms 
Don’t ask me to repeat it 
Don’t suffocate my heart 
I don’t know what I’m feeling

Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through? 
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you 
(Don’t ask me)
Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through?
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you

Don’t fall into my arms
I’ll only disappoint you (I’ll let you down)
Don’t go sounding the alarms
When all I do is want you

(So, don’t ask me)
Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through? 
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you
(Don’t ask me)
Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through?
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you

Let me wake up, heavy head, lying in my bed with you naked. 
Go put that song on that you love on repeat until we can’t take it. 
I wanna drink pink lemonade watching movie trailers ͚till it’s late. 
And let’s remember all the ones that we think are gonna make our hearts break.

(Don’t ask me)
Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through? 
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you 
(Don’t ask me)
Do you wanna talk, do you wanna talk it through?
Swear I ain’t got anything on my mind
I don’t wanna talk to you

You, thinking of you, I’m just thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you, thinking of you, I’m just thinking of you
Thinking of you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Outro]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My youth is yours

Rian Johnson enters the Star Wars conversation with his 2017 film, The Last Jedi, becoming the second director ever to both write and direct a Star Wars movie. Rey and Kylo Ren continue their journey while questioning the galactic establishment as we know it.

Expectations were high - exceeding them for some, while disappointing for others. Still there is a lot to love about this movie, and it's place within the franchise.

We have a lot of friends and family who did not enjoy this movie, and that's OK. No one is rebuked; you are loved either way. But let's take a minute to have a friendly chat about Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

Beggars are a sad reality of life. And we can’t lie, we all feel sad when we see a beggar. A ton of empathy pours through us, and we can’t help but open our hearts - and our wallets.

These characteristics are fundamental in one of their main training drills, the 'rondo.'

In the following video from the training archives, the Barça first team players show their skills with three consecutive 20-touch rondos. Up to 60 passes were made with Luis Suárez and Joan Barbarà, the assistant coach, in the middle.

Check out the reaction from the Uruguayan and his teammates when the three rondos were completed, as well as the punishment they had in store for Suárez!

Frank Pinello meets with a fourth-generation pizzaiolo and a new-school dough wizard who show us that there's not one style defining Philly pizza, and that's a good thing. Between ingredient shopping at the South 9th Street Italian Market and trying the Philly Taco on South Street, Frank gets the full tour of the Philadelphia pizza scene before heading out to Roots Country Market in Lancaster to meet with seventy-year-old Norma Knepp who can make pizza with (or better than) the best of them. There's so much delicious pizza packed into the state, we're petitioning to have it renamed Pizzalyvania.

Originally released just two days prior to Blonde as a visual album, Endless is an absolute fucking experience of an album. It is even more unlike anything I've heard than Blonde is, and easily his best album in terms of vibe (imo.)
This remastered version of Endless was put on his blonded.co site for Cyber Monday in 2017. It was sold in the form of a vinyl record, a CD + a DVD, and a VHS tape, along with two accompanying posters. All of them have this really cool holographic look to them.
The vinyl and CD +  DVD got delayed by a couple months but they eventually got here in early 2018.

https://discord.me/futura
Discord is basically a modern chatroom with text and voice chat capabilities. There are a lot of different channels in a server for a lot of different interests that you may have (futura has a channel for music, venting, photography, production, and more as of the time that I'm writing this.) It can be kinda confusing to use at first, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
Futura is unique in that is has a monthly radio show that a member from the server makes, and we all get together to listen to it at the end of the month. They usually have really crazy transitions and stuff.
I'm no longer in the server, but the last time I linked it in my descriptions, a lot of people joined and found that the place fit them really well, so I figured I'd start that up again.
If I ever end up back in there, I'll be using the name @Marlow, so if you wanna hang out and i'm there, you know who to @.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I hold no rights or copyrights over this music. This is not my music, and I intend to make no money or profit off of this. I simply posted it here as an archive for other people to enjoy so that they can experience this beautiful album. Copyrights go to Frank Ocean and BOYS DON'T CRY. If anyone from Frank Ocean's team want me to take this down, just contact me and I'll get it down quick.

Please support the official release and spread the word. I'm unaware of where you can purchase this particular version of Endless at this moment, but I do know you can get the original video version on Apple Music still."

Jaden Smith was once a promising actor, but something happened on his rise to fame to cause him to disappear from the spotlight. While children of Hollywood stars often find it difficult to step out of the shadows cast by their famous folks, Jaden has been doing everything in his power to create his very own shadow since the moment he was old enough to perform. But as Jaden grew from a young boy to a young man, his relationship with Hollywood began to sour. The early box office promise he'd shown all but vanished, and the actor/rapper/philosopher has been distancing himself from Hollywood ever since...

They jeopardize your health — both mentally and physically. And they waste your time and energy.

So why do we still do them? And most importantly, is there anything you can do about it?

I've previously written about the science of how habits start, so now let's focus on the practice of making changes in the real world. How can you delete your bad behaviors and stick to good ones instead?

I certainly don't have all of the answers, but keep reading and I'll share what I've learned about how to break a bad habit.

Before we talk about how to get started, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating. Want to check out my insights? Download my free PDF guide “Transform Your Habits” here.

What causes bad habits?
Most of your bad habits are caused by two things…

Stress and boredom.

Most of the time, bad habits are simply a way of dealing with stress and boredom. Everything from biting your nails to overspending on a shopping spree to drinking every weekend to wasting time on the internet can be a simple response to stress and boredom.

But it doesn't have to be that way. You can teach yourself new and healthy ways to deal with stress and boredom, which you can then substitute in place of your bad habits.

Of course, sometimes the stress or boredom that is on the surface is actually caused by deeper issues. These issues can be tough to think about, but if you're serious about making changes then you have to be honest with yourself.

Are there certain beliefs or reasons that are behind the bad habit? Is there something deeper — a fear, an event, or a limiting belief — that is causing you to hold on to something that is bad for you?

Recognizing the causes of your bad habits is crucial to overcoming them.

When we fail at habits repeatedly, we lose trust in ourselves, don’t believe in our ability to stick to something, feel guilty and sometimes disgusted with ourselves.

This is a bad state of affairs for our future habits.

When we start a new habit, if we don’t really believe in our ability to stick to it, we’re less likely to succeed. We’ll doubt ourselves when things get a little harder. When we feel like quitting, part of our minds will say, “Ah, I knew this would happen. This just confirms what I thought about you, you loser.” And then we quit, instead of sticking it out and beating the quitting feeling.

Well, that’s not good. What’s better, though?

If you trust yourself to stick to a habit, you feel confident in your ability to get through tough times. You know that even if you get the feeling of quitting, you can beat it. Or if you fail, you know you can start again, get back up and learn from the mistake and try harder."

The Sour Patch Kids met in high school in Wichita, Kansas in 1964 and within two years were touring the world. At the time, they couldn’t have known they would become the biggest pop act of the decade, but with the perfect blend of talent, timing and dedication their ascension seems almost preordained in retrospect. Jimmy Redd’s swooning vocals, Janet Cherry’s lead guitar, Bill Lemon’s bouncy bass and Martha Green’s driving drums were met by screaming fans from Kansas to Kyoto. The songs “My Sugar Kid” (1965) and “Your Sour Smile” (1967) are now considered important contributions to the American music canon.
These were the good years. The band’s legend grew and the money poured in. Their label, Sweet Sounds Music Group, pushed them to reach their audiences in new ways, building out their merchandising arm into clothing, lunch boxes and even a sour sugar-coated gummy candy. However, the label was also arguably responsible for the band’s downfall. In response to slightly drooping numbers, the label, citing a clause in the band’s contract that the four excited teenagers did not notice before signing back in 1964, added a new member to the group: Barry Blue. The new member of The Sour Patch Kids was not well received, within the band or by the fans. Critics considered his music style to be a step backwards to the band’s earliest sound, which many considered them to have grown out of. And in May of 1969, the creative differences came to a head and the band broke up. The label had the original four members blacklisted and they stopped making music all together. The only remnant of their success is the music they made and the Sour Patch Kids candy which remains popular to this day.

It's a formula that's spawned a wave of ""Stunt Food""—food whose sole purpose is to rack up likes on your Instagram feed. Chefs may not crave this kind of food, but it's no secret that they're also natural competitors. When they see something on their social feed, their first instinct is to say ""I can do it better."" So in the spirit of duking it out in the kitchen, Alvin goes head-to-head with Top Chef alum Ilan Hall to see who has the chops to make the craziest, most gonzo Stunt Burger. And they've got an all-star panel of judges—Sean Evans, Matty Matheson, Miss Info—to see if they've gone too far.

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Padma Lakshmi, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

My feet are taking me are taking me to your front door 
I know I shouldn't though
Heaven only knows 
 
PRE:
That Ooh the side effect 
To my loneliness is you 
 
CHORUS:
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
VERSE:
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with 
One too many drinks 
 
PRE:
But ooh, if late night friends 
Have consequences, cool 
 
CHORUS:
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
Ooh I think about it all the time 
Make it happen in my mind 
I'm telling you, yeah
 
Ooh, you're all that I want 
No good at giving you up
Cmon and gimme some love tonight
 
BRIDGE:
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went lookin for a sign but instead I got a message 
I take off my pride every time we undressing 
I draw the line
I'm out of line, yeah

Five years later they were household names with their hit single ""MMMBop."" The three brothers have been recording songs and touring the world ever since, and they've also started their own record label and beer company. We chatted with Hanson about their current tour, how they got into the beer business, and what's next for the trio. Following is a transcript of the video.

Zac: Hi. I'm Zac. That's Taylor. This is Isaac. We all have the same last name. It's Hanson.

We are a band called Hanson.

Taylor: We've been playing music for 25 years, and somehow we have not killed each other yet.

Zac: Yes.Which is really the only achievement we've achieved. As far as achievements go.

So, one of our most famous songs is called ""MMMBop.""

Talking about how we got started is a little different than, I think, most bands, because ...

Taylor: We were so young.

Zac: We're brothers. And two:  we were incredibly young. I was 6.

At that time, we were just singing. I mean, we were just a vocal group. We had ... we all played piano at some level.

We played a ton of schools. And we were able to sort of be this reflection of potential for kids. That was really the first place we saw screaming girls.

Isaac: Yeah, exactly.

Zac: I think that's why maybe we weren't quite as shocked by it when, you know ...

Taylor: when it happened in a big way.

Zac: ... international stardom came.

They say that you're most likely to meet your significant other at work. And we are a part of that statistic. We all met our wives playing concerts.

Our inspiration was '50s music. Was rock 'n roll. Was looking at young artists who had started in their teens. The Jackson 5 and Chuck Berry ...

Taylor: The Beach Boys.

All: Buddy Holly.

Taylor: The heart of this band is to be creating things. And to be inventing things. And to be excited about the future.

We started a record company, you know, on our third album, before I was twenty years old.

We have put out six major studio albums. We have a global fan base that we still tour with all the time, year after year.

We chose to start a record company, because we could see that there wasn't a future at a major label that was focused on quarterly earnings and sort of stacking stacking artists like assets that they could just trade.

And really the decision in starting a record company was about whether we were invested in our own future, or whether we were going to really just become a commodity.

We set up a distribution deal, built a new team with a new management company, and did a lot of stuff that nobody had any idea how to do.

Five years ago, we started a beer company. Four years ago we started a craft beer and music festival. And really had a passion for craft beer and the culture around craft beer as well.

Isaac: Which I think is one of the more important things really, about the kind of craft beer experience. At least for us in a lot of ways. Besides obviously making quality beer. But the community itself actually felt very similar to the music community.

Taylor: Mmmhops is a title of a beer, not the whole company, but the title of our first beer. And it is definitely one of those, you know, names that's so ridiculous that it just had to be. It had to exist. And it's been fun to share that with people.

The Christmas album has been a long time coming. And ever since the first one, which was received so well ...

Isaac: Back in 1997.

Taylor: Yeah, twenty years ago.

There was a trickle of, ""Are you guys gonna make a follow-up?""

People expect to be reflective. To be reminiscent. To go back and be nostalgic. And so they expect to open up the box of things that they loved, and come back to it.

Zac: Certain anniversaries just can't be ignored. And when we reached 25 years this year, it seemed like it was important to kind of stop and look back a little bit more than we normally would.

We decided to do a tour, really talking about the history of the band. You look at it the audience, and you see your peers, and you see their kids, and you see their parents.

Taylor: You know, the future of music is not just this one-way street. Where we send things out, and then people applaud. It's you share music, and you get a response. And then you hear the response. And you hear the interaction between fans. And then you keep trying to create opportunities for that to grow. And, for us, there actually are potentially twenty-five more years or more in our future, if we choose it. And it feels like we're at a place where we can make that choice.

Better Days Lyrics:

You and me
We’re gonna make it together
Just wait and see

You won’t even remember, the struggles in search of our
Better Days
Better Days than before
Better Days
Better Days are coming

I concede
We’ve had a few misadventures
We fight and seek
Just trying to live up
To our potential
But I believe

Even the hard times, will one day resemble
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days than before
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days are coming

What we face
Will one day be inconsequential
To make it through

The will to believe is all that’s essential
Some days it may feel like we’re running out of time
The jump from fantasy to reality can be hard to define

Better days are coming
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days than before
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days are coming
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Searching for a better day
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days are coming
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Searching for a better day
Better Days, Better Days are coming
Better Days are coming

Here's how it works.

Learn why the triple axel is such a big deal: http://bit.ly/2oGrA7N

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

At the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, Mirai Nagasu became the first American woman to land a triple axel in an Olympic event, just the third woman ever to accomplish this feat. She failed to cleanly land the same jump at the 2018 US Figure Skating Championship, in San Jose California, but she still received 6.07 points for the jump, almost two points more than her teammate's perfect double axel, which received 4.09 points. Figure skating score is complicated, and the new scoring system has changed how competitors skate. But how does it work?

We will have to play two almost perfect matches to qualify.""

It will be a special duel for the midfielder, who will return to the stadium where, in the 92nd minute of Barcelona’s semi-final against Chelsea on May 6, 2009, he scored to ensure Barça’s passage to that year’s Champions League final. ""It was a golazo and fate wanted the ball to go in. From a personal point of view, it’s one of the best moments I’ve experienced in sport,"" he remembered fondly.

The Blaugrana captain also analysed the state of form in which his team finds itself ahead of the Stamford Bridge duel: ""The team is in a good moment and we have to take advantage of it. We can’t make any concessions because we will be penalised. Each game is a story and every knockout is different.”

Watch the video of Andrés Iniesta’s statements before the duel against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge!
----
El próximo reto del FC Barcelona será conseguir un buen resultado en el partido de ida de los octavos de final de la Liga de Campeones. Andrés Iniesta lo tiene claro: ""La eliminatoria será dura y exigente y nos marcará. Tendremos que hacer dos partidos casi perfectos para clasificarnos"".

Será un duelo especial para el centrocampista barcelonista, que volverá al escenario en el que, en el minuto 92 del 6 de mayo de 2009, dio al Barça la clasificación para la final de la Champions. ""Fue un golazo. El destino quiso que el balón entrara. A título personal es uno de los mejores momentos que he vivido deportivamente"", recuerda el ""8"" barcelonista.

El capitán azulgrana también ha analizado el estado de forma en que llega el equipo al duelo de Stamford Bridge: ""El equipo llega en un buen momento y lo tenemos que aprovechar. Debemos pensar en hacer dos partidos serios y no hacer concesiones, porque en la Champions penaliza mucho"". ""Cada partido es una historia y cada eliminatoria es diferente"", sentencia Andrés Iniesta.

¡Consulta en este vídeo las declaraciones más destacadas de Andrés Iniesta previas al duelo contra el Chelsea en Stamford Bridge!

But who can stack the tastier plate of tortilla chips, cheese, and toppings—Sean Evans or Bon Appétit's Brad Leone? Stepping into the nacho-battle terror-dome (otherwise known as the Bon Appetit test kitchen), Sean goes head-to-head with another YouTube food legend. As the host of Bon App’s “It’s Alive,” Brad is used to getting wild with his ingredients. But will home-court advantage be any match for Sean’s Chicago-inspired platter? Find out when Bon Appétit Deputy Editor Andrew Knowlton issues his final verdict.

The lightsaber is the Force made visible, sensible, concrete -- the mental transformed into the physical. What really makes the lightsaber special is that it’s the bridge between the Force that’s felt inwardly, and the Force that’s manifested in the outer world. The lightsaber is not just elegant and civilized  -- it’s inspirational, telling us that what we feel and believe can have a direct, visible mark on the world… if we understand how to access and control the Force.

This is my first 'Guest Artist' video. Charlotte and I spoke about doing something before the summer but it wasnt until after summer holidays and right before New York fashion week at the beginning of September that we were both free to film this! Everyone is so incredibly busy with shoots etc but I hope to have a guest artist every month (or two depending on schedules!). Hope you enjoy!

You’ve probably heard by now that getting injured by any rusty object can lead to tetanus. Tetanus is caused by bacteria known as Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil, dust, and animal feces – all ideal places for rusty objects to be found. Anyway, if this bacteria enters your body through the wound, you're in really serious problems...

Random questions like these keep the most curious of us up at night so today's video will answer them! And if any of your most burning questions will be missed, then ask away down in the comments – we’ll be sure to cover them next time!

SUMMARY:
- Your kidneys can only process 27-33 ounces of water an hour. If someone drinks more than that, then it can cause swelling in their entire body, including the brain! 
- Most gum today is made from natural or synthetic polymers, most commonly butyl rubber. The muscles of your digestive tract move it along, and eventually, gum “exits” your system in a day or two, in the normal way.
- Your lazy sleepy feline friend is actually a really important member of the global ecosystem! Without cats, Earth would quickly become overrun by rodents. Mice and rats would spread disease, wipe out ground-nesting birds, and probably destroy grain supplies.
- What would happen if the Earth lost oxygen for 5 seconds? Since oxygen in the air protects our skin from UV light, we’d get sunburns right away. Also, oceans would evaporate because water is one-third oxygen. 
- A day without the internet would really hit the financial sector. Credit cards and online banking would stop working because banks wouldn’t be able to access and verify information. 
- The absence of regular washing will lead to scalp inflammation, which will most likely result in dandruff. So scratching your stinky dirty head would become your new not-so-favorite pastime. 
- What if the Earth started spinning twice as fast? The surface of our planet would become quite unrecognizable since Indonesia and most of the northern part of South America would go totally underwater. 
- Without the stabilizing effect of the Moon, our planet would start to spin more quickly. Our climate would change drastically, resulting in extreme temperatures and seasons. And, of course, since there’d be no moon to pull on them with its gravity, there’d be a big drop in the difference between high tides and low tide levels.

Cairo breaks down cuts of salami, ham, bologna, mortadella, hot dogs, sausages, and prosciutto. For each round of deli meats, Cairo visually scans, smells, and taste tests each meat before guessing which deli meat costs more. Once the prices were revealed, Cairo explains why a specific deli meat costs more and dives into specifics on what to look for in a deli meat.

If anyone's confused by the break free worst performance, I had to take it out because of copyright, I had uploaded this video a lot earlier but mtv or whatever blocked it because I used a performance from 3 fucking years ago and they still care about it apparently. So i had to edit my already edited video so that probably messed with the quality and im sorry about that, I'm leaving this to upload and process overnight. 

This is no hate towards Ariana by the way, if anything I think this video shows how much more she is capable of!

I didn’t, though. I didn’t break down. I just sat there, waiting. I’m not sure what I was really waiting for. I think I just wanted a sign, or something. Like, from the universe, saying it wasn’t the end, and that I should keep fighting. But I never got that sign. Must’ve been forever before I realized my guardian angel wasn’t gonna fall from the sky and make him love me again. No amount of false hope or sadness was gonna fix my heart, so when I realized that and finally decided to get up from my spot where I feel like I’d been sitting for days, I kind of just… accepted it. I accepted that the moon stopped following me home and the girl I loved didn’t love me anymore. This wasn’t a fairytale and I wasn’t a kid anymore. It was time to let go. I had to let go. So I did. I let go.

These stories don’t make the headlines often, so stay tuned to hear about all the secret children of famous people!

7. Mercedes Ruehl
Younger audiences may not be too familiar with the name “Mercedes Ruehl” anymore, but once upon a time she had a thriving career. In the 90s, she won both a Tony and an Oscar. Most recently, she starred in a few episodes of the show Power and continues to work in Theater. Back when she was 28 years old, right before her career took off, she gave birth to a son named Christopher who she gave up. In 1995, she adopted a son, Jake, with her husband, David Geiser. A few years later, she was reunited with Christopher. He ended up becoming Jake’s Godfather!

6. Patti Smith
Rockstar, poet, and visual artist Patti Smith has been dubbed the “punk poet laureate.” It’s hard to believe she’s now 72 years old. She became famous thanks to the song “Because the Night,” co-written with Bruce Springsteen. When Smith was 19 years old, she became pregnant out of wedlock. During her pregnancy, Smith’s parents sent her to a foster home to keep the baby a secret. Being very young and having no money, Smith gave up her baby immediately after giving birth. As far as anyone knows, the two have not met again since. 

5. Joni Mitchell
Joni Mitchell already broke up with former boyfriend Brad MacMath when she found she was pregnant. She had just started her music career and had no money to pay for heat in her house, let alone raise a child alone. It was 1964 and abortion and the pill were not available in Canada. A child out of wedlock was also looked down upon, so Mitchell saw she had no choice. The public was unaware of Mitchell’s child until 1993 when her former roommate sold the story to a tabloid magazine. At the time, Mitchell’s daughter, Kilauren Gibb, was already searching for her biological parents. The two reunited in 1997.

4. Kate Mulgrew
Kate Mulgrew is best known for her roles as Captain Kathryn Janeway on Star Trek: Voyager and as Red on Orange is the New Black. She began acting at the age of 17 when she was accepted into the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting in New York. In her junior year, Mulgrew landed a role on the soap opera Ryan’s Hope. When she accepted the position, she discovered she was pregnant. The producers didn’t want to hire anyone else, so they wrote Mulgrew’s pregnancy into the show. However, because she had no support from her family or the baby’s dad, Mulgrew had to give up her child for adoption. She tried looking for her child not long after she gave her up but didn’t find her until the late 80s. 

3. Chuck Norris
  Walker, Texas Ranger himself had a child that was given up for adoption. Martial artist and actor Chuck Norris had an affair with a woman during the 1960s. He didn’t know she became pregnant with their daughter, Dina. The woman married someone else shortly after the romance and raised her daughter with Dina thinking that the woman’s husband was her birth father. When Dina was much older, she overheard her mother saying that her real dad was Chuck Norris. Dina soon reached out to Norris, and they eventually reconciled.

2. Peter Michael Escovedo
Peter Michael Escovedo is the brother of singer and actress Sheila E. Peter himself is also a musician and comes from a famous musical family. He and his partner Karen Moss had a daughter together but could not afford to provide for her. That daughter is Nicole Richie. When she was three years old, she moved in with adoptive parents Lionel Richie and Brenda Harvey. Richie is one of many celebrities that were adopted, a list that includes the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Kristin Chenoweth, Steve Jobs, and Jamie Foxx!

Maybe you know him as @MakeupByMario on Instagram. Or maybe you know Mario Dedivanovic as the man behind our modern obsession with highlighting and contouring. Arguably one of the biggest and most influential makeup artists of all time, Dedivanovic has spent decades delicately painting the faces of celebrities and then turning around and teaching all of us how to recreate the look through tutorials and his global Masterclass series. So you can imagine that his personal makeup collection is...large. Very, very large.

In this episode of #TheBeautyShow, Dedivanovic let BAZAAR visit his New York City home to get a tour of his beauty stash—including his makeup closet, cologne collection, Yeezy shoe wall, and medicine cabinet. But his stash of products is so big that it actually starts in a storage room, where thousands of items are sent to him every month from beauty brands all over the globe. It's there that they're sorted and organized by his assistants, and only the essential products for his kit come home with him. 

You can shop all of Mario's go-to products here:

ABOUT THE FOUR 
FOX will team up with iHeartMedia on the new music competition series THE FOUR: BATTLE FOR STARDOM. THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.

ABOUT TALENT RECAP 
Talent Recap is the #1 independent website which is exclusively dedicated to the fans of the most popular talent shows around the world. As passionate fans of these shows, we provide news, analysis and fan engagement on America’s Got Talent, Britain’s Got Talent, The Voice, The X Factor, American Idol, The Four and its contestants.

On the season finale of Sean in the Wild, Sean Evans teams up with YouTube cooking legend Maangchi for a crash-course in one of the world's most celebrated chicken dishes. That's right, Sean and Maangchi are joining forces to batter, sauce, and double-fry their own batch of spicy Korean fried chicken. From Maangchi's past life as an online gamer, to KFC's humble beginnings in 1980s Korea, Sean and Maangchi bond over plates of gochujang-covered drums and flats.

Why do we see art differently? Today, I take another look back at The Last Jedi and its polarizing reception to analyze how we watch movies and why we’re so tribal about them.

**********************************

This week I tackle the legendary Long Island Iced Tea! Created in the 70's by bartender Bob ""Rosebud"" Butt for a cocktail contest hosted by Oak Beach Inn.  The version I'm presenting here is slightly rebalanced by Jeffrey Morgenthaler but goes down just as easy as the original. And that's kinda of the point with this drink, it's a basically unoffensive way to put a lot of high proof spirits passed your lips. 

Long Island Iced Tea

.75 oz. -or- 22 ml. Lemon JUice
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. gin
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. rum
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. tequila
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. vodka
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. Dry Curaçao / triple sec
.25 oz. -or- 8 ml. simple syrup
shake & pour
.75 oz. -or- 22 ml. Coca Cola
Garnish with lemon twist

When preparing to welcome a new arrival into the family, expecting parents will take all sorts of steps to ready themselves and their home. They’ll read all of the baby books, childproof the house, buy more diapers than they can count, and paint the nursery.

However, when one couple in England learned that they would be having a little girl, the father-to-be had a pretty unique idea. Instead of the usual stuff, he set out to complete a plan that would take more than six years to finally come to fruition. But when it did, it was totally worth it…

When one unnamed English father found out that his wife was going to give birth, he knew it was time to start getting ready. However, his idea of preparing for his first child wasn’t what most people might expect…

Animal Lyrics:
I told you something safe 
Something I’ve never said before
And I, I, I, can’t keep my hands off you 
While you lie in the wake
Covered all in the night before
I’m high, high, high, no one’s got me quite like you
 
I want you all to myself 
Don’t leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
 
No angels could beckon me back
And it’s hotter than hell where I’m at 
I am an animal with you
 
An ode to the boy I love
Boy I’ll die to care for you
You’re mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to 
And as the days fly by
We’ll be more than getting through yeah
And in time, time, time, we’ll build a home for two
 
I want you all to myself 
Don’t leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
 
No angels could beckon me back
It’s hotter than hell where I’m at
I am an animal with you
 
All is right in the meadow
When I’m lying next to my fellow
Baby that’s you
Baby that’s you 
 
One way trip like an arrow,
All laid out like a tarot
Baby that’s you
Baby that’s you
 
I want you all to myself 
Don’t leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
 
No angels could beckon me back
And it’s hotter than hell where I’m at
I am an animal with you 
 
I am an animal with you

Subscribe Now! ► http://bit.ly/SubClevverMovies

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge travels to a galaxy far, far away! That’s right, the Star Wars cast & director have joined the throngs of celebs and everyday folks who have decided to douse themselves in cold water to help raise money and awareness to ALS. Things got started when Oscar Isaac gladly accepted the challenge from Garrett Hedlund along with two veiled people he claimed to be fellow cast members Adam Driver and Harrison Ford who apparently were “in costume” and therefore couldn’t be shown on camera. Things continued when Daisy Ridley, who is rumored to be the lead throughout the next Star Wars trilogy, accepted her quote, “ice nomination,” and poured what seemed like extra cold water on herself. Ridley then added Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to the equation who wasted no time in nominating his fellow new Star Wars cast members, telling them it’s time they pulled their weight. Mark then tried to pull a Jedi mind trick, thinking he could only fill a dropper full of cold water on his head, but those bearing witness weren’t affected by Luke’s awesome powers, which must be rusty after 30 years, and he was then doused in sweet, cold, cold water. We’re guessing he proceeded in slicing open a Tauntaun and climbed in to get warm after the camera stopped rolling.  Or at least, we’re sure that’s what fellow cast member and stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder Harrison Ford would have suggested.  And yes, Han Solo himself, looking just fine after recovering from an apparent Millennium Falcon-related leg injury, accepted his challenge graciously and stoically, as only a crusty smuggler gone-legit could. Ford refrained from nominating other cast members, instead taking his focus to several doctors, one of which was a medical consultant on Ford’s 1993 film, The Fugitive. Continuing the challenge though was Ford’s co-pilot and walking rug, Chewbacca, sometimes known as Peter Mayhew. Peter and his wife, Angie, adorably accepted their nomination and were thoroughly showered in water. I guess Wookiees don’t like to get wet. Not forgetting to nominate other cast members, Mayhew challenged new Star Wars additions Andy Serkis and John Boyega who have yet to accept the challenge, but we’re sure they’re forthcoming. Perhaps Serkis will do a mo-cap inspired take?  Of course, Star Wars Episode VII’s fearless leader, JJ Abrams couldn’t be left out. Having been nominated by fellow sci-fi connoisseur Steven Spielberg, Abrams then took his aim at those who are famous for not having any aim at all – Stormtroopers! Challenging the famous 501st Battalion, a league of Stormtrooper fans, the 501st gladly took orders from their default leader, completing the challenge in unique ways that only Stormtroopers could dream up. Of course there was one other challenge taken – Mr. Bleep-blop-bloopity-bleep himself, R2D2 took the challenge and was doused by a very pleased Sandperson.With rumors circulating that part of Episode VII will once again take place on the ice planet Hoth, we’re thinking these ice bucket challenges are just the cast way of preparing for their roles.  Seriously though, what we’ve seen is a tremendous amount of support for raising awareness to a disease that affects so many people daily. Celebrities, citizens, and Star Wars heroes and villains alike have done a fantastic job ensuring that people across the world are aware of ALS and know that they or anyone can do something to support.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

[Bridge]
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, oh)
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
(Living for your every move)
Oh my, my, my

To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking

Damn...

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room
Yeah it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking
I might have to tell you something...

Damn…

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me

I like me better when I'm with you
(yes I do, yes I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you
(oooh noooooo)
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

(I like me, I like me)
(Look who you made me, made me, oh nooooo)
Better when
I like me better when i'm with you"

Earlier this month Rice Gum dropped a major hint on Snapchat that we was secretly filming a SuperBowl commercial for Monster with Iggy Azalea. If this is true this would make him the first YouTuber to be featured in a SuperBowl ad - making YouTube history! We cannot wait to watch it on SuperBowl Sunday... how about you?

In an extraordinary interview, former FBI director James Comey called Donald Trump ""morally unfit to be president"" and said he believed it was possible the Russians were holding compromising personal information over the head of the commander in chief.

Comey's comments and his new book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, are fueling a combustible moment in Washington that could become a constitutional crisis. At the White House, Trump has unleashed a barrage of angry tweets against Comey — calling him an ""untruthful slime ball,"" among other insults — amid reports he was poised to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for his role in the Russia investigation that Comey once headed.

Never before in American history has a current or former director of the FBI, the nation's principal law-enforcement agency, publicly described a president in such a scathing manner.

Do you like comics and celebrities who also happen to like comics? You’re in luck! We at Collider have a variety of original shows ranging from pundit-style Movie Talk to the more utility-based Best Movies on Netflix, and now we’re happy to introduce a brand new show for our channel: Comic Book Shopping. Each episode will find a different celebrity or personality going to a local comics shop with host Jon Schnepp and sifting through and discussing their favorite comics.
 
In this inaugural episode we’re joined by Evan Goldberg, co-creator/co-director of the AMC series Preacher and co-writer/co-director of films like This Is the End and The Interview. Goldberg explains how he first got involved with Preacher and how his love for the comic instill a bond at a very young age with his creative partner Seth Goldberg. And with Season 2 of Preacher premiering on Sunday, June 25th, Goldberg also teases what fans can expect from the second season (he and Rogen directed the first two episodes) and also talks about their long-term plans for the series.
 
At the end of the episode you can see which comics Goldberg and Schnepp chose to buy, but the rest of the show is interspersed with their expert recommendations. So if you like Goldberg’s work and are interested in Preacher, but are also interested in some comic book recommendations, this show is a must-watch.

With the Red Wings trailing 2-1 and searching for the equalizer on the power play, Detroit's Martin Frk lined up a one-timer from the left circle that sailed and appeared to hit Girardi up high with 6:31 to go in the second period.

Girardi immediately fell face first onto the ice as trainers from both teams rushed out to his aid. With concerned Tampa Bay and Detroit players watching, Girardi remained down on the ice for a couple minutes before sitting up under his own power. Girardi skated off the ice with some help from Steven Stamkos and Victor Hedman and headed immediately back to the locker room."

Originally released just two days prior to Blonde as a visual album, Endless is an absolute fucking experience of an album. It is even more unlike anything I've heard than Blonde is, and easily his best album in terms of vibe (imo.)
This remastered version of Endless was put on his blonded.co site for Cyber Monday in 2017. It was sold in the form of a vinyl record, a CD + a DVD, and a VHS tape, along with two accompanying posters. All of them have this really cool holographic look to them.
The vinyl and CD +  DVD got delayed by a couple months but they eventually got here in early 2018.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Yo, if you want a cool community of people that like Frank Ocean and a bunch of other artists like him, check out this discord server: 
https://discord.me/futura
Discord is basically a modern chatroom with text and voice chat capabilities. There are a lot of different channels in a server for a lot of different interests that you may have (futura has a channel for music, venting, photography, production, and more as of the time that I'm writing this.) It can be kinda confusing to use at first, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
Futura is unique in that is has a monthly radio show that a member from the server makes, and we all get together to listen to it at the end of the month. They usually have really crazy transitions and stuff.
I'm no longer in the server, but the last time I linked it in my descriptions, a lot of people joined and found that the place fit them really well, so I figured I'd start that up again.
If I ever end up back in there, I'll be using the name @Marlow, so if you wanna hang out and i'm there, you know who to @.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I hold no rights or copyrights over this music. This is not my music, and I intend to make no money or profit off of this. I simply posted it here as an archive for other people to enjoy so that they can experience this beautiful album. Copyrights go to Frank Ocean and BOYS DON'T CRY. If anyone from Frank Ocean's team want me to take this down, just contact me and I'll get it down quick.

Please support the official release and spread the word. I'm unaware of where you can purchase this particular version of Endless at this moment, but I do know you can get the original video version on Apple Music still."

But which ingredients make for the perfect stuffed pizza? Andrew Rea—the mastermind behind the wildly popular cooking channel, Binging with Babish—is here to face off against Sean Evans in a calzone cook-off for the ages. That's right, it's the season sendoff you've been praying for. In typical Binging with Babish fashion, Andrew whips up a Seinfeld-inspired pizza pocket, filled to the brim with the kind of cheese, pepperoni, and eggplant wolfed down by George Costanza. It's a difficult dish to beat, but Sean has an unlikely ace up his sleeve—a calzone clone of one of America's favorite Tex-Mex meals: The Cruchwrap Supreme. Will Andrew's sitcom special be enough to impress legendary pizza man Mark Iacono, or will Sean break his losing streak and finally bring home a W from Lucali? Find out on the very special, Season 2 finale of Sean in the Wild.

Halloween costumes will always have a special place in our hearts. They're what got us started and we still love making them. We decided to make two on trend costumes (Scoops ahoy and Jessie from Toy Story) and two timeless ones (Alice in Wonderland and a Vampire). We'd love to see all of your halloween costumes whether we made it this year, or 8 years ago. Tag us on instagram using #sorrygirlssquad

you've got your chain
tied to me tight tie me up again
who's got their claws
in you my friend
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock
and sweet you roll
Lost for you I'm so lost for you

You come crash into me
And I come into you
I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare boned and crazy for you
When you come crash
into me, baby
And I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream

If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
to forgive me
in my haste
When I'm holding you so girl
close to me

Oh and you come crash
into me, baby
And I come into you
Hike up your skirt a little more
and show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
and show your world to me
In a boys dream.. In a boys dream

Oh I watch you there
through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
wear it so well
tied up and twisted
the way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash
into me


***************************

Who got you off when you got yours?
Who was the first to spill your soul?
Who got you off? Well, I'm the one
Dreamed of doing it day and night
Oh sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock and sweet you roll
Oh I swear over and over
It's you like a wave into me

When you come crash into me baby
Please come crash into me
Come crash into me
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

No miss you all (?) what runs your way?
Who runs up side you and begs everyday?
Who's watching you through your window?
Night Comes
Who celebrates with the moon?
That you're like a wave come again

Come and crash into me baby
And I come into you
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

Oh now it's here I build my soul
I swear, friend, don't you know
I'm bare boned and crazy for you

Oh when you come crash into me yeah
And you come into me
And you come into me

Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
In a boy's dream yeah
In this boy's dream

(Dixie Chicken outro)
I'll be your Dixie chicken
You be my Tennessee lamb
And we will walk together
Down in Dixie land

Crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me

Oh I wanna play with you"

Lyrics: 

The second someone mentioned you were all alone 
I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins 
Now I know, It’s got a hold 
Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparking up 
These cigarettes wont stop me wondering where you are 
Don’t let go 
Keep a hold 

If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse
its a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace 
Cause we’ve all made mistakes, if you’ve lost your way 

And I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 

Tell me what’s been happening
What’s been on your mind?
Lately you’ve been searching for a darker place to hide
That’s alright
But if you carry on abusing you’ll be robbed from us 
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs 
Just come home 
Don’t let go 

If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse
its a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace 
Cause we’ve all made mistakes, If you’ve lost your way 

I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 

If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse 
It’s a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace 
And if you’ve lost you way, if you’ve lost your way 

And I know your down and out now but I need you to be brave 
Hiding from the truth ain’t going to make this all okay 
I feel your pain; if you don’t feel our grace then you’ve lost your way

And I will leave a light on 
I will leave a light on 
Cause I will leave a light on"

But for many natives, it’s the homegrown, backyard burger traditions that keep the burger scene here alive and well. Just ask Alvin, whose childhood growing up in East L.A. is filled with memories of grilling burgers on Sundays and watching the area’s famous lowrider clubs cruise the boulevard. Today, he’s linking up with Together Car Club to talk shop about the communal power of backyard burgers and why lowriders and grilling go hand-in-hand.

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!"""

From the glory of deep-fried patties, to the mechanical wizardry of steamed cheeseburgs, Alvin receives a master class in regional burger styles.

First We Feast's ""The Burger Show"" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

In this epi of Thrift Flip, we created a chilled out, music inspired vibe with items all found from the thrift store. We diy'd a gorgeous vinyl record stand out of an old dish rack and took a wooden (thing?) and upcycled it into a beautiful gold crescent moon shelf!

Lyrics:

I remember you and me 
Back when we were 17 
Drinking kissing in the street
We couldn't get enough 
I see you laying there with me 
Like my missing puzzle piece 
Dreaming of what we could be 
I couldn't make you up 

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you 
I always saw you reaching and catching stars 
We had the thing that everyone wanted 
Hung on your sleeve you wore your heart on it 
Did you get out I'm wondering where you are 

Did you follow your follow your fire 

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you 
I always saw you reaching and catching stars we had the thing that everyone wanted 
Hung on your sleeve you wore your heart on it 
Did you get out I'm wondering where you are 

Did you follow your follow your fire 
Did you follow your fire 

That time we stole your daddy's car 
And drove around til it got dark 
We slept outside in Phoenix Park 
We couldn't get enough 
We promised that we'd never part 
On a tree under the stars 
We carved or names into the bark to be there when we're not 

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you 
I always saw you reaching and catching stars 
We had the thing that everyone wanted 
Hung on your sleeve you wore your heart on it 
Did you get out I'm wondering where you are 

Did you follow your follow your fire 

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you 
I always saw you reaching and catching stars we had the thing that everyone wanted 
Hung on your sleeve you wore your heart on it 
Did you get out I'm wondering where you are 

Oh oh oh 

Did you follow your follow your fire 
Did you follow your follow your fire 
Did you follow your follow your fire 

I remember you and me back when we were seventeen drinking kissing in the street we couldn't get enough"
